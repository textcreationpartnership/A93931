         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:137285:6"/> within then without, and the Miracles more inward then outward. Miracles of a more ſpiritual nature to appear in the inward man, to the beating down of every ſtrong hold: and therefore thoſe outward miracles are ſwallowed up of inward miracles, of a more glorious nature: the one being a type of the other, as the outward man was a type of the inward man; and therefore my work ſhall be in this Chapter, to ſhew you my reaſons why I conceive that Miracles in a viſible way, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And this was one end, for which Miracles were given to hold forth the coming of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>2. Miracles were to confirm the Covenant of grace, which was to be eſtabliſhed as firm as the firſt; for when the firſt Covenant was given out, it was ratified with ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for all the Mountaine was on fire, and there were thunderings and lightnings, and voices, and ſo terrible was the ſight, that it made <hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God tremble: So ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible were the ſignes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18. 19. 22. And thus you ſee the firſt Covenant was ratified with Miracles, and ſo alſo was the ſecond, which is a better Covenant eſtableiſhed upon better promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. And alſo more glorious Miracles of a more ſpiritual nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the Miracles of the firſt Covenant were more outward and terrible: But the Miracles of the 2. Covenant are more inwardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:137285:7"/> comfortable, which did accompany the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their Miniſtry, confirming the truth by ſignes and wonders, <hi>Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 16. the laſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 10. 11. And thus did the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf alſo confirm the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel with more Miracles, then ever any word was before from the beginning of the World; ſo that you may ſee that the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles wanted not Miracles to confirm it: God the Father alſo bearing witneſs with ſignes and wonders, and divers gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 4. That it might appear the Covenant was the more glorious, and more excellent, firm and ſure: being ſo wonderfully ratified and confirmed with Miracles. And thus you ſee a ſecond Reaſon wherefore Miracles were on foot, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to confirm the truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>
               <p>Now a third reaſon wherefore Miracles were on foot, was this: even to confirm the calling and Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, who were to lay the Foundation both for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practiſe, which the World was to follow in after Ages, to the end of the World, For we are built upon the Foundation of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf being the chief corner ſtone. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 20. In being the Authour both of their Doctrine and Practiſe;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137285:8"/> and therefore you ſee it was requiſite, that Miracles ſhould attend the Apoſtles in their Miniſtry; who were to ſet forth ſuch a way to the world, that was never before heard of: neither can there be a more glorious way ſet forth, or more glorious Miniſters then Chriſt and his Apoſtles were; to ſet forth a way to the World, to walke in in future ages; and therefore the Father, even the God of Heaven and Earth, did ſo honour the way of the Goſpel with his Sonne, and ſuch glorious Miracles, that were never acted before ſince the World ſtood; whereby he did manifeſt his probation of their way.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you ſome reaſons wherefore Miracles were on foot, even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the truth, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did ſet forth. Now, I ſhall alſo ſhew you reaſons and grounds, wherefore I conceive that Miracles are ceaſed, which are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We have received a ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, to the which we do wel if we take heed 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. For a ſtanding Word as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is, is a more ſurer ground of Faith, then all the Miracles in the world; that our faith ſhould not be built upon men, but upon the Word of God, which endureth for ever. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 25. For to ground our Faith upon miracles, is but a rotteu foundation; becauſe when miracles
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137285:8"/> ceaſe, our Faith muſt ceaſe: and ſo we ſtand at a great loſſe, being built on ſo uncertaine a ground; but it is not ſo with the people of God, who are built upon the Rock and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, their way being undeniable, and by the which way we muſt be judged at the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Reaſon is this, Miracles were to accompany Apoſtolicall men in thoſe Apoſtolicall times, to ſet forth an Apoſtolicall way to the World; which they were to ſtand to, being ſo gloriouſly confirm'd with mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as any way could be confirmed: ſo that now to look for miracles is vaine, except you look for a better way, and better work-men then the former were; which to do, is to race the foundation of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Becauſe it cannot appear that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe Apoſtolicall times that miracles were on foot, or that any after thoſe times did work miracles: neither <hi>Timothy</hi> nor <hi>Titus</hi> in their ordinary miniſtery, nor any of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the ſeaven Churches of <hi>Aſia;</hi> but were to looke unto the forme of ſound Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, which they had received from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. which was the foundation of Chriſtian Doctrine and practiſe, whereon the people of God are to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:137285:9"/> build in every age; For other foundation can no man lay then Chriſt hath laid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. And ſo it doth appear, that after the Apoſtles times, there was no looking for miracles; for they knew, the Goſpell was as gloriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with Miracles as was poſſible to be.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If we looke for miracles now: what do we elſe but queſtion the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and fly in the face of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to condemn them of inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, as not being able to ſet forth ſuch a way for all men to walk in; which is ſufficient to ſave them if they believe in it; and alſo of force to condemn, if they do reject it? But this is clear, where the Apoſtle ſaith, that Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire, to render vengeance againſt them that obey not the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1 8.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, If we muſt have Miracles now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; then why not Miracles alſo, to confirm our belief, and miracles alſo to keep us in the Faith; which if ſo, then we may caſt off the Scriptures, and build our Faith upon Miracles, &amp; then if miracles ceaſe, we ceaſe to believe: and ſo if there be no Miracle there is no Faith; if no belief, then no ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, If we muſt build our Faith upon Miracles, and nothing be true to us in the Scripture, till it be confirmed by a Miracle; then, how will you diſcern between a falſe

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>racle, and a true, ſeeing that a pretender may do the like: and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ou may take a falſe miracle for a true, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pture to your utter damnation?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Whether doth not this Tenent queſtion the State of all our fore-fathers, from the Apoſtles to this preſent time, that their faith was in vaine, and their ſalvation uncertain, ſeeing they wanted miracles to confirme it to them, and ſo were in a ſad condition? and the like I may ſay of you that ſtand ſo much for miracles: what if you die before you enjoy a miracle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the truth unto you and ſo build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſand? is not your condition ſad that your ſalvation ſhould depend upon a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſo be damned?</p>
               <p>8. Whether doth not this Tenent ſet up the Pope and his Adherents, who may ſay by this reaſoning, that he is in the right way, and others in the wrong: becauſe they have miracles to confirm their way, and thereby prove their Church to be true: the Pope working a miracle every year, whereby he doth perſwade them that his way is right, and all the wayes of others falſe, becauſe they have not miracles to confirm their way?
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:137285:10"/> and therefore the Pope by this may plead that he is right, and others wrong, and ſo we ſhall juſtifie the generation of the wicked to confirm them in their wickedneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the people of God, becauſe they have no miracle.</p>
               <p>9. I may ſay to ſuch as Chriſt ſaith to the Scribes and Phariſees under the Law, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, if they would not believe them, neither would they believe if one ſhould riſe from the dead to work miracles:</hi> and ſo I ſay, we have Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and he that will not believe the truth ſet forth by them confirmed before by miracles, neither will he believe if one ſhould riſe from the dead, and do all the miracles in the world.</p>
               <p>10. It doth appear that miracles are cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe the Scriptures do declare that ſuch as ſhould work miracles in the laſt dayes, ſhould be falſe Prophets, ſhewing ſignes and wonders, <hi>and that Satan ſhould come with all lying ſignes and wonders to draw men from the truth, that they might believe a lye, that all thoſe might be damned who obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſſe, 2 Theſ.</hi> 2. 9. 10. And this I believe is the Divels grand deſigne in theſe dayes, to make men believe, that the Scripture is not true without miracles to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, that thereby he may deceive the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:137285:10"/> world, and ſet up his own falſe miracles in ſtead of the true: and this may be the reaſon why he puts it into the hearts of men in theſe dayes that miracles and dreams are above the word, that thereby he might have them where he would, and ſo deceive them with a falſe miracle, as he doth the greateſt part of the world at this day, as the <hi>Turks</hi> who are deceived with the falſe miracles of <hi>Mah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 letters">

But theſe ſpirits are the ſpirits of devils, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Kings of the earth, and the whole world, Revel. 16. 14. But the Lord will take that beaſtly worſhip of the Beaſt, together with the Beaſt, and the falſe Prophet, with his lying ſpirit, that wrought miracles to deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and will caſt them into the lake of his wra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now there is ſome objections to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as <hi>Joel</hi> 2. where the Lord doth foretell, <hi>that young men ſhall ſee viſions, and old men ſhall dream dreams:</hi> and that that propheſie is in part to be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>To the which I do reply, with the words of <hi>Peter,</hi> who had a more ſpirituall diſcerning then any in theſe dayes to diſcerne the truth of propheſies, that that propheſie was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled upon them when the viſions of the Lord did appear unto them in <hi>Acts</hi> 2 1, 2, 3. who were the Lords young men, who were to declare the minde of God to the whole earth: and that being ſuch a publick prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, it was publickly fulfilled to perfect a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick work to the admiration of the beholders who were very deſirous to know what was the meaning of thoſe ſtrange works, and the Apoſtle flies to the propheſie of <hi>Joel</hi> for their refuge, and tels them it was no more then what was propheſied of them: and that they might now ſee that propheſie fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 16. 17, 18. and that thoſe were the dayes that were ſpoken of before, being glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel-times, in which the Lord was to accompliſh his promiſe, that there might be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to ratifie &amp; confirm the truth of the Goſpell: ſo that this propheſie being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> doth appeare by the Apoſtl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:137285:11"/> words: if any do pretend in theſe dayes the like revelations, they muſt alſo ſhew the like effects which I think they cannot.</p>
               <p>10. I ſhall ſpeake a word or two of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell-viſions, whereby it will appear that that there are no ſuch viſions in theſe dayes: and firſt thoſe viſions did appeare in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>viſible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the ſight of the beholders, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and then ſecondly, they were able to confirme what was revealed in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to them by a viſible ſigne or wonder: and thirdly, they were able to ſpeak in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner to convince the gain-ſayers; and fourthly, thoſe viſions were for the truth, and not againſt it: ſo that from hence I conclude, that the cauſe is taken away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the effect ceaſeth; for if they prove the like viſions, they muſt alſo prove the like viſible manifeſtations; or elſe they are falſe viſions. And as for the dreamers there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, you may ſee that was fully fulfilled in thoſe dayes in the Scribes and Phariſees, thoſe old and ancient Doctours of thoſe times, who ſtood dreaming as men amazed, when they beheld the Lord Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, the mirrour of the world, to preach ſuch glorious doctrine, accompanied with ſuch glorious miracles; and their doctrine being ſo ſtrange and rare, and ſo unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:137285:12"/> preaching, with ſuch authority, and ſo mightily, convincing the gain-ſayers: the Doctors alſo themſelves being ſo wonderfully confuted, that we may truly ſay, That they were in a dream, or trance: whereby the propheſie was truly fulfilled.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Object.</hi> is in <hi>Marke</hi> 16. Theſe ſignes ſhall follow thoſe that do believe. So that hence they do inferre, That there is no true Goſpel-Preachers but ſuch as work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: which if this be true, then there is no faith in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe no true Miniſtry; for <hi>faith comes by hearing, Rom.</hi> 10. 17. even by hearing the word preached, <hi>and how ſhall he preach except he be ſent:</hi> ſo that if there be no Preachers, there is no faith, &amp; then there is no ſalvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for if the Miniſtry of faith ceaſe, then faith muſt ceaſe: which if ſo, then to what purpoſe do your Miniſters teach, ſeeing they work no miracles, ſo that by this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both you and your Miniſters are in a falſe way.</p>
               <p>And further if our ſalvation depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on miracles, would God have been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting think you ever ſince the Apoſtles time to have ſent them into the world to have perfected their ſalvation to the full? for certainly, if we could not have been ſaved without them, God would never have been
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:137285:12"/> wanting to have ſent them: But God had ſo fully before confirmed the Goſpel with ſuch Miniſters and Miracles, which is ſufficient to confirm the truth in all Ages.</p>

               <p>To the which I reply, and how ſhall we know the truth by a Miracle; ſeeing a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may do the like, and ſo you may take a falſe Miracle for a true? or how will you prove that your Miracle to be true? if not by the word, or elſe it may be falſe for ought you know: muſt not the word try your miracle, whether it be true or falſe? and therefore to the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to that, they are in a falſe way, <hi>Iſaiah 8. for the word of the Lord is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, and ſharper then a two-edged Sword, Heb.</hi> 4. 12. to pierce through all the falſe wayes of men, and to cut in peeces all falſe worſhips whatſoever; and it is a ſearcher of the heart, and a tryer of the raines, to ſearch into all the hearts of men and their actions, to judge them according to their works.</p>
               <p>2. Who muſt end all contentions, muſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:137285:13"/> not the word which is able to ſatisfie all doubts, and to direct us in all our wayes? and what need we fear, having ſo glorious a Guide as the Goſpel is? can you find a better Rule to walk by, or a better Guide to lead you, which is the Reſolver of all doubts; for if the word cannot ſatisfie you, who can? And now I ſhall ſpeak a word or two for the word of my God; for where will you find a Chriſt but in the word? and where will you find the promiſes of Chriſt but in the Word? doth not the Word hold forth Chriſt to you, and holds forth the promiſe to you? doth not the word ſhew you the way of life? if you would know what Doctrine is right, doth not the word ſhew you what Doctrine and what worſhip you ought to obſerve? doth not the word hold forth unto you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and unholineſs, life and death? and ſhall not the word judge you at the laſt day for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very idle word? and is not this the word of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 12. 48. Conſider therefore all you that forget God, will not his word find you one day, and accuſe you at the bar of juſtice for all your contempt, and then what anſwer will you make: will you ſay his word was falſe or true, will you condemn your judge that ſhall judge you? the Lord give

But the proud Scribes and Phariſees rejected the grace and mercy offered them, and reſpected the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world above the riches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>he came unto his own, but his own received him not, John</hi> 1. 11.

And thus you ſee they were called, but they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come, and therefore the fault was theirs and not his; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>A ſower went forth to ſow, and ſome ſeed fell upon good ground, and ſome fell upon bad ground, and ſome ground brought forth fruit, and ſome brought forth none:</hi> Now the ſower is Chriſt, and the ſeed is the word of grace, and the ground is the World: Now it doth appear, that the fault was not in the ſower, for he ſowed good ſeed, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 34. And the ſame ſeed was ſowen upon the bad ground, as upon the good; but you may ſay, how came the ground

               <p>And now I ſhall come to Reaſons, to ſhew you wherefore ſo few imbrace the Goſpel, 1. Becauſe the promiſes of the Goſpel are ſpiritual, and promiſes of another life, and therefore ſo few receive it; for if the Goſpel promiſed to make men rich men, and great men in the World: then all would be Goſpel-Profeſſors, becauſe they would be rich and great men in the World, and to be honoured of men, and to injoy all the glory of the fleſh for to have the prayſe of men, and to have the World on their ſide; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Goſpel holds forth no ſuch thing, but contrariwiſe thoſe that imbrace the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, looſe the ſavour and eſteeme of the World, and are hated of all men, as contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible men of another World, as not worthy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Is becauſe the Goſpel holds forth a ſelf-denying Creature, that a man muſt deny himſelf in the honours, riches, and pleaſures of this life, and love Chriſt above all; for he that loves Father or Mother, Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or Brother and Siſter, or any thing in the world more then <hi>Chriſt.</hi> is not worthy of him; and he that doth not denie himſelf and take up his Croſſe, and follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be his Diſciple, <hi>Mat. 10. 34.

Marke</hi> 6. 3. 4. being offended at him, and declaring againſt him, ſaying, <hi>Art thou greater then our father Abraham, and the Prophets? John</hi> 8. 53. and thus they undervalued the Perſon of Chriſt to make his doctrine contemptible in abaſing his Perſon, that thereby they might ſet up themſelves, ſaying, <hi>We are Abrahams children, John 8. 39. but for this fellow, we know not whence he is, John</hi> 9. 29. and thus did the proud Scribes and Phariſees of thoſe times contemne Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, as if they were the baſeſt men in the world, and thus they do in theſe dayes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem of the perſons of ſo me, if he be an Univerſity man, and have learned the ſpirit, as they conceive, at the Univerſity, with the knowledge of the humane tongues, and have received his humane degrees, then they admire his Perſon, and eſteem him ſome great man, or divine perſon, having bought the ſpirit at the Univerſity, as the people

Firſt, I ſhall ſpeak of the firſt <hi>Covenant,</hi> and then of the ſecond: now the firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> was but typicall, and therefore it was the good pleaſure of the Father to ſend the Son to take away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. that is, he takes away the force of the firſt, that the ſecond might come in place: which is a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. now that the firſt was a typicall Covenant, will appear for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:137285:24"/>1. The firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> was an adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the letter, and therefore it was a typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Covenant, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was written and ingraven in Tables of ſtone, which was a Type of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace, which was to be written and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the fleſhly Tables of the heart; and therefore it was a typicall <hi>Covenant, verſe</hi> 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was an adminiſtration of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore it was a typicall <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, verſe</hi> 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was a Law of ſin and death, and therefore it was a typicall <hi>Covenant, verſe 7. Rom.</hi> 8. 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It was to be done away, and to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and therefore it was a typicall <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, verſe</hi> 1. 11. 13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It was a wounding Covenant, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wound, and to ſhew the weakneſs of the Creatures, for by the Law came the knowledge of ſinne, but it was not able to heale; and therefore it was a typicall <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>

               <p n="8">8.

               <p n="9">9. The firſt Covenant conſiſted of Types and ſhadowes, for the Law had a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 2. and therefore it was a Typicall Covenant.</p>

               <p n="12">12. The worſhip was typicall, and therfore it was a typicall Covenant; for there being a change of the Prieſthood, there muſt alſo be a change of the Law, as you may ſee, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 12. for the firſt worſhip was but on foot till a better worſhip came, and then it was to be done away: as the tenne words were but a typicall Worſhip; for, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods but me.</hi> And, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> and that is this, thou ſhalt worſhip me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Covenant and according to the Lawes of that Covenant; for if thou doſt not worſhip me according to my Covenant and according to the Lawes thereof; thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipeſt another God, and doſt not worſhip the Lord thy God; for if thou chuſeſt another way of worſhip then I have preſcribed, and change thy worſhip, thou alſo changeſt thy God; and this is the full intent and meaning of the firſt Covenant, an outward acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of God to all the world, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Lawes and Ordinances preſcribed and ſet forth by him, whereby they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be their God: which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:137285:25"/> God did accept of till a better came, until the time of Reformation, as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. and then the Father would ſend the Son, the great Miniſter of God, who did adminiſter a better Covenant and better ordinances to the world; and when that way was come they were to live no longer to <hi>Moſes</hi> and his teaching; but were to live under the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt; which the Father did confirme when he ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, hear him; Mat.</hi> 17. 5. but they rejected the teaching of the Son, and did not look to the end of that worſhip which was aboliſhed by Chriſt, as you may ſee 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. and ſo their minds are blinded unto this day, living in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow when they might have embraced the ſubſtance; and therefore they miſſed ſalvation, becauſe they ſought it by the firſt Covenant and not by the ſecond: though they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous to worſhip God according to the firſt Covenant, as you may ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31. 32. and ſo they ſtumbled and fell, as you may ſee, <hi>ver.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, that the worſhip of the firſt Covenant, was but to coutinue till a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came in place; for when Chriſt came there was a change, as you may ſee in all his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and in his declaring, that neither at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:137285:26"/> nor in the Mountaine ſhould they worſhip God; that being but an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the letter, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. but they ſhould worſhip in the way of the Goſpel, which is an adminiſtration of the Spirit, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 3. 8. which is a better worſhip then the former was, being a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better promiſes.

He pacifies the Fathers wrath for the tranſgreſſions of the firſt Covenant. And ſecondly, He doth the worke of the firſt Coenant. And thirdly, He takes away the firſt by eſtabliſhing the ſecond; and ſo I ſhall begin with the firſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt, He pacifies the Fathers wrath; for the firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> was a <hi>Covenant</hi> of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. For the Law was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, till the ſeed ſhould come; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19. and ſo terrible was the ſight thereof, that it made <hi>Moſes</hi> quake and tremble, to ſhew that wrath was gone out againſt ſinne; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 20. 21. being a Law of ſinne and death. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes and takes away the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:137285:26"/> and was made a curſe for us, being <hi>the Lamb of God that takes away the ſinnes of the World, John</hi> 1. 29. and ſo we are delivered from the Law, that being dead wherein we were held, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. and hath redeemed us from the curſe; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and hath broken downe the middle-wall of partition, and hath aboliſhed and taken away the Law of enmity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 15. 16. by blotting out the hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Ordinances, and all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> worſhip which was againſt us; and hath ſpoiled or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that enmity that was between God and as by reaſon of ſinne; and hath made a free paſſage between God and our ſouls, having conquered all oppoſitions, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. 16. that thereby we might come with all boldneſſe to the throne of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. and therefore it is that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath taken away the firſt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> becauſe it was a <hi>Covenant</hi> of bondage, and the Ordinances thereof; and ſo he gives us right and freedom to imbrace a <hi>Covenant</hi> of love and mercy, that is more eaſie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He hath taken away the firſt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> in doing the work of the firſt <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;</hi> for the firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> did require a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work of a perfect man, but there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:137285:29"/> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>they were all gone aſtray, and were all gone out of the way,</hi> ſo that <hi>there was none that did good no not one,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. So that none were able to do the work of the firſt <hi>Covenant;</hi> and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to come to do the worke of the firſt <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> being a perfect man, without ſpot or blemiſh, and ſo he was able to do a perfect worke, to fulfill the righteouſneſſe of the firſt <hi>Covenant;</hi> For the firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a worke of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, which none were able to perform till <hi>Chriſt</hi> came; who when he came, did all that the firſt <hi>Covenant</hi> did exact, in doing ſuch works as never man did: and ſo fulfilled the whole Law, and all the righteouſneſſe and holineſſe thereof: and ſo he is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to every one that believeth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. And therefore he is declared to be righteous and juſt, and the juſtifier of all that believe in him: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 25 26. ſo that, <hi>as by the offence of one many were made ſinners: even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſhall many be made righteous. Rom.</hi> 5. 19. And for this work of his, God hath highly exalted him, and hath made him Heir of all things. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. And thus you ſee, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done the work of the firſt <hi>Covenant,</hi> and ſo is the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:137285:29"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt takes away the firſt, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing the ſecond; for finding fault with the firſt, he ſaith, <hi>Behold the dayes come ſaith the Lord, that I will make</hi> or eſtabliſh <hi>a new Covenant,</hi> and ſo he takes away the firſt, that he may eſtabliſh the ſecond: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9. and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is become a Miniſter of a better <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. For if the firſt had been found fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, there had been no place found for the ſecond; but finding fault with the firſt, he ſaith, <hi>Behold, the dayes come ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant,</hi> and in that he ſaith, <hi>a new Covenant,</hi> he hath made the firſt old, and that which is old is ready to vaniſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. 8. 13. And thus you ſee the firſt was but a typicall <hi>Covenant,</hi> and was but to continue untill a better came, which is a better <hi>Covenant</hi> &amp; a better way then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was; Aud thus I have ſpoken a word or two of the firſt <hi>Covenant,</hi> and now I ſhall ſpeak a word or two of the ſecond.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I ſhall ſhew you how the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> of grace is eſtabliſhed, and that is theſe three waies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by promiſe, for no ſooner there was a wound by the firſt <hi>Covenant;</hi> but there was a promiſe of healing in the ſecond, ſaying, <hi>the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:137285:30"/> ſeed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and this was alſo promiſed to <hi>Noah, Gen</hi> 6. 18. and more fully manifeſted to <hi>Abraham,</hi> in many promiſes made unto him at divers &amp; ſundry times <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and the 17. 7. and a more plainer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made to <hi>Moſes,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 18. where the Lord ſheweth, that he would ſend the great Prophet, or Angell of his <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> and would put his words into his mouth that he might ſpeak all that the Father ſhould command him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. 19. And thus yon ſee all along how the <hi>Covenant</hi> was eſtabliſhed by the promiſe of the Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Covenant</hi> was eſtabliſhed by prophecy as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa. 42. 6. ch.</hi> 49, 6. as alſo in <hi>Jer. 31. 31. And it ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt daies, that I will make a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Houſe of Iſrael, and with the houſe of Judah, not according to the Covenant I made with their Fathers, in the day that I tooke them by the hand, to bring them out of Egypt; which Covenant they brake though I was a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band unto them ſaith the Lord; but this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with them ſaith the Lord</hi> And thus you ſee, that it was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Prophecy.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:137285:30"/>
               <p>Thirdly, It was eſtabliſhed by the bloud of the Teſtatour, for a covenant is ratified by bloud, as alſo the firſt covenant was; for when <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſpoken every precept to all the people according to the Law, he took the bloud of calves and of goats, and ſprinkled both the book and the people, ſaying, This is the bloud of the covenant, which God hath enjoyned unto you, for without bloud there is no remiſſion, <hi>Heb,</hi> 9. 19. 20. 22. and therefore the ſecond covenant was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ratified with bloud. even by the bloud of the Son of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. For where a covenant is, there muſt alſo be of neceſſity the death of the Teſtator, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bloud of Chriſt is called the bloud of the covenant. <hi>Heb. 10. 29. chap. 12. 24. chap.</hi> 13. 20. And thus the Covenant is ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed by the bloud of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the bloud of the everlaſting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſhewed you in a word or two, how the Covenant was eſtabliſhed, and now I ſhall ſpeak a word or two of the Covenant it ſelfe: now the eſſence or being of the Covenant, is God, who out of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> love, and unexpreſſible mercy, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der compaſſion, was pleaſed to give a being
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:137285:31"/> to the Covenant, to manifeſt to all men that he was not in anger but in love, that though his anger lay in the Covenant of the fleſh, yet his love lay in the Covenant of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for he ſeemed to ſhew anger in the type and ſhadow, but his great love doth appear in the ſubſtance and truth, in the Covenant of grace to manifeſt his great love to all men: and thus much for the being of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and now for the matter of it.</p>
               <p>Now the matter of the Covenant is the mind of God, conſiſting of promiſes of love and mercy unto all men, as you may ſee <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10. 14. upon condition of obedience unto the Lawes and Ordinances of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant proceeding from the minde of God, from whence all the teaching of the Goſpell and ordinances thereof do proceed as you ſee <hi>Deut. 18. 17, 18. For the Son doth nothing of himſelfe, but what he hath received of the Father, in being taught of the Father what to teach. John</hi> 8. 20. 29. And ſo being to toach the mind of the Father, both for promiſes and commands to the world, from the minde of God: and thus much for the matter of the Covenant, conſiſting of Promiſes and Ordinances, proceeding from the minde of the Father, and now of the matter it ſelfe.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:137285:31"/>
               <p>Now the Covenant of grace is called a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament or will, being indeed <hi>the will of the Father revealed to the Son, and by the Son revealed to the world, to manifeſt the Fathers love unto the ſonnes and daughters of men: and teſtified to the world, that what he declared was the minde of God, and ſealed it with his bloud, and ſo his bloud is called the bloud of God, or the bloud of the teſtament, or will, Heb. 10. 19. chap.</hi> 13. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is called a new Covenant, becauſe it makes the firſt old, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the old bondage of the firſt, that there might be Goſpel-freedome in the ſecond; that ſo we may ſee how far the one doth exceed the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is called a new Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it doth not wax old as the other did, but is to continue for ever, and is an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is to continue until the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, Mat.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is called a new Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is new in every age, and to every ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration it is a new covenant, bringing new covenants in every age, which are green and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uriſhing afreſh in all generations, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the glory of the Goſpell beyond the glory of the firſt: the glory of the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:137285:32"/> and the glory of the other grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng and increaſing: and thus much of the covenant.</p>
               <p>Now the parties covenanting, are the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son; for the Father ſtrikes a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Son, that he ſhould teach all men: and to do his will in declaring glad tidings to all the ſonnes and daughters of men, and to manifeſt his love to the world, as you may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. ſo that if they do imbrace the grace and mercy offered them they may live, and this doth appear by the words of the Father himſelfe; that this is truth, for he ſaith, <hi>As I live, I will not the death of a ſinner, but that he live, Ezek.</hi> 18. 32. and doth manifeſt the ſame in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. 6. where he ſaith, <hi>That it was a ſmall or light thing that Chriſt ſhould be his ſervant to raiſe up the Tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Iſrael, but I will alſo give thee a light to the Gentiles, and thou ſhalt be my ſalvation to the end of the earth, to eſtabliſh the earth, and to cauſe to inherit the deſolate heritages, that thou maiſt ſay to the priſoners, come forth, and to them that are in darkneſſe, ſhew your ſelves, Iſai.</hi> 19. 6. 8. 9. And thus you ſee the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the Father, <hi>For it is good and acceptable in his ſight, that he will have all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:137285:32"/> to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 3. 4. and conſulteth not that any man ſhould periſh, <hi>but that all men ſhould come to repentance, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 9. And for this end, the Father hath inabled the Son with all ſufficiency, being full of grace and truth, and giving all power into his hands, whereby he might be the better inabled to do the ſame: and thus the Father frees himſelfe in giving all ſufficient power unto the Son, whereby he might teach all men, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Covenant on his part: and thus you ſee the incomprehenſible love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he ſhould engage himſelfe thus unto the world, that he would ſend his Son to be a Teacher to all the world, ſo <hi>that this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> And ſo it doth appear, that the Father is not wanting on his part to give light unto the Son, that the Son might not be wanting on his part to give light to the world.</p>
               <p>And then in the next place, the Son ſtrikes a covenant with the Father, for theſe are the parties covenanting, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, For there is one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who is called the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>gel of the Covenant.</hi> And the Mediatour
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:137285:33"/> between God and man, who ſtrikes a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the Father, ſaying, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will O God, for thus it is written of me in the volume of thy book to do thy will O God, Heb.</hi> 10. 1. And ſo the Son covenants with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do his will, <hi>For I came to do the will of him that ſent me, and to declare his mind to the world;</hi> and ſo he teaches all men as he himſelfe doth declare, when he ſaith, <hi>When I am aſcended, I will draw all men unto me, John</hi> 12. 32. And theſe are the words of Chriſt, who was never wanting to fulfill his word, for he drawes all men as you ſhall ſee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the Works of creation, <hi>As the heavens declare the glory of God, and the earth ſheweth forth his handy-worke, day unto day uttereth ſpeech, and night unto night teacheth knowledge, and there is no place where their voyce is not heard; for their line is gone through the whole earth, and their words unto the end of the world, Pſam.</hi> 19. 1. 2. 3. and thus you ſee Chriſt drawes all men by the works of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every creature indeed being a Goſpel-Teacher, <hi>Col. 1. 23. For that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, even the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall power of God, and the Godhead, ſo that they are left without excuſe, Rom.</hi> 1. 19. 20. ſo
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:137285:33"/> that Chriſt drawes all men by the workes of creation which are as a naturall eye to ſee the Sun.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Chriſt drawes all men by Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-manifeſtation, and therefore the Goſpell is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Goſpell being preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every or in every creature, as you may ſee <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 29. and therefore Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth declare that the Goſpell muſt be preached to all the world, as you may ſee <hi>Mat. 24. 14. for a witneſſe to all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end ſhall come.</hi> And thus Chriſt is not wanting to preach the Goſpell. <hi>For as by the ſinne of one man death came upon all men to judgement, even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one the free-gift came upon all men to juſtification of life, Rom.</hi> 5. 19. For this is the command of God, that all men ſhould believe in the Son, &amp; he that doth not, maketh God a lyer, becauſe he believes not the record that God gave of his Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. And thus you may ſee, that Chriſt is not wanting on his part to teach all men: <hi>For this was the end</hi>

               <p>Now it doth appeare, the covenant doth extend unto all men, as in the propheſie of <hi>Eſay 2. 6. chap.</hi> 49. 6. where the covenant was promiſed to all both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and in the words of the covenant it ſelfe, it ſeems to be clear, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. where the words are theſe, <hi>And they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them, and they ſhall be all taught of God, John</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:137285:37"/> 6. 45. and I will powre out of my ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all fleſh, as <hi>Joel</hi> 2. which are new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant words, and all fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 6. wherewith it doth appear that it doth extend to all men; for as the wound came upon all men under the firſt Covenant, ſo the healing muſt extend to all under the ſecond Covenant, or elſe the plaiſter is not ſo great as the ſore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. and now I ſhall ſhew you ſome Reaſons, wherefore the Covenant doth extend to all.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth mediate for whole man, as it doth appear in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. for there is one Mediator between God and Man the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and therefore the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant muſt extend to all men, becauſe he mediates for whole man, even for all that were loſt in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Covenant doth extend to all men, becauſe Chriſt is a propitiation or Sacrifice for our ſinnes, and not for our ſinnes onely, but for and of the whole World, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 2. whereby it doth appear that the Covenant doth extend to all men.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. Becauſe the Covenant extends as far as the blood, <hi>for the blood is the blood of the Covenant, Heb. 9. 14. ch.</hi> 10. 29. Now the blood of Chriſt doth extend to all men, as doth appear in that he died for the chief of ſinners. 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. and came to juſtifie the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, Rom. 4. 5. in dying for them,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. and ſo God commendeth his grace towards us, that while we were ſinners Chriſt died for us, <hi>verſe 8. who died for his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, verſe 10. and taſted death for all men, Heb.</hi> 2. 9. and therefore it doth appear, that the Covenant doth extend to all men, becauſe the Covenant extends as far as the blood.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It doth appear that the Covenant doth extend to all men, becauſe ſuch as ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, ſhall be condemned for rejecting the Goſpel as the Apoſtle doth declare, when he ſaith that God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men according to the Goſpel, <hi>Rom. 2. 16.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:137285:38"/> to thoſe that know not God, and obey not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, 2 Theſ.</hi> 1. 8. 9. and this is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, that light is come, and they love darkneſs rather then light, <hi>John</hi> 3. 19. Now if the Covenant extend ſo far as to judge all men: then it doth appear that it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all men.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Covenant of grace is a Covenant of love, and the love of God doth extend as far as his anger; for he is the God of love, and therefore his mercies are over all his works, and the enmity is ſwallowed up of love, his love being a free love, and his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a free Covenant; and therefore it doth appear that his Goſpel doth extend to all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his love doth much more appear when it is extended to all, then when it is extended to ſome, &amp; thoſe that deny the truth of this, deny the free love of <hi>God:</hi> &amp; thus I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the extent of the Covenant, and now I ſhall ſhew you wherein the two Covenants do agree.</p>
               <p>Now the Covenants agree in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctrine and practiſe of the firſt Covenant was one, for they taught one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and practiſed one way, both they and their Generations, and ſo were to do, and not to turn to the right hand or to the left,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:137285:38"/> but juſt according to the Command, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 1. 2. and ſo under the Goſpel there is one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and one practice, as you may ſee in all the Goſpel; for the Apoſtles of Chriſt all taught one Doctrine, and practiſed one thing, as you may ſee in all their Doctrine and practice; and this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Tymothy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>hold faſt that forme of ſound words which you have been taught, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 13. ſo that therein the firſt and ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant agree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that kept the firſt Covenant had right unto the promiſes and bleſſings, and had right unto all the Ordinances thereof, but thoſe that broke that Law were curſed, and had no right unto any promiſe therein, and ſo thoſe that keep and obey the Goſpel are bleſſed, but thoſe that reject and contemn the Goſpel are curſed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. 8.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All the Lawes and Ordinances of the firſt Covenant were in force while the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was on foot; for he that did but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect circumciſion, was to be cut off from the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. and ſo alſo all the Laws and Ordinances of the ſecond Covenant are on foot while the Covenant ſtands; for take away the Ordinances, and take away
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:137285:39"/> the covenant alſo: and therefore he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any Ordinances under the Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the councel of God to his own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 3. and therein the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond covenant agree.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt covenant was a conditionall covenant, as you may ſee by the words of <hi>Moſes, Levit.</hi> 26. 46. and ſo alſo is the ſecond a conditional covenant; for Repentance and Faith are the conditions of the covenant, without the which none ſhall be ſaved; <hi>for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you repent, you ſhall all likewiſe periſh, Luke 13. 5. and he that doth not believe ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, John</hi> 3. now I am not ignorant that moſt men conceive the Covenant to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any condition at all, but abſolute, and the, ſtrength of their Argument lies in the words (ſhall) and (will) <hi>as I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people;</hi> and ſo they take theſe words to be without any condition, to the which I reply, that the words <hi>ſhall</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> are both in the <hi>future tence,</hi> and are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall words: as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Iſrael, thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me, and thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve:</hi> now if this word had bin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any condition, then they ſhould never have choſen other <hi>Gods,</hi> nor have fallen from the worſhip of God; but you ſee they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:137285:39"/> other Gods: &amp; therefore it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the word <hi>ſhall</hi> is a conditional word. Again the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ye ſhall keep my <hi>Sabboths:</hi> now if this word <hi>ſhall</hi> were without any conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then they ſhould never have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Sabboth; but they broke the Sabboth, &amp; therefore it doth appear, that the word <hi>ſhall,</hi> is not without any condition; and then the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Iſrael, you ſhall walk in all the wayes that I have commanded,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 33. Now if this word (<hi>ſhall</hi>) had been without any condition, then they ſhould never have diſobeyed the Commands; but we ſee they did, and therefore the word (<hi>ſhall</hi>) is a conditional word, and ſo they ſhal be my people is but a conditional word, that is this: <hi>if they imbrace my grace &amp; mercy, they ſhall be my people,</hi> and if not, <hi>they ſhall not be my people:</hi> and for the other word, (<hi>I will be their God</hi>) and alſo the word (<hi>will</hi>) is a conditionall word as doth appear, <hi>for as I live ſaith the Lord, I will not the death of a ſinner:</hi> now if there were no condition in this word (<hi>will</hi>) then all men ſhould be ſaved, and Chriſt ſaith, when I am aſcended I will draw all men: now if there be no condition in the word (<hi>will</hi>) then all men ſhall be drawn, and he will that all men ſhould be ſaved: and he will not that any man ſhould periſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:137285:40"/> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. now if the word (<hi>will</hi>) be without any condition, then all men ſhall be ſaved, and no man ſhould periſh; but all that diſobey the Goſpel ſhall periſh, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. &amp; therefore you ſee that the words <hi>ſhall</hi> &amp; <hi>will</hi> are conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, &amp; therefore the covenant of grace, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Covenant; for as I have ſhewed, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith are the conditions of the Covenant, without the which none ſhall be ſaved, and therein the firſt and ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant agree: and now I ſhall ſhew in a word or two wherein they differ.</p>
               <p>The firſt Covenant is old, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant is new, and therein they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: the firſt, the Law of the letter, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Law of the ſpirit; the firſt was written and ingraven in Tables of ſtone, the ſecond is written and ingraved in the fleſhly Tables of the heart; the firſt a Law of death, the ſecond a Law of life; the firſt a Law of bondage, the ſecond a Law of liberty; the firſt a wounding Law, the ſecond a healing Law; the firſt a naturall Law, the ſecond a ſpirituall Law; the firſt a Law of types, the ſecond a Law of ſubſtance; the firſt was to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the ſecond is to continue; the firſt a Law of earthly bleſſings, the ſecond a Law of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual bleſſings; the firſt is to a natural death,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:137285:40"/> and the ſecond to a ſpirituall death; the firſt was to ſtand for a time, and the ſecond is to ſtand for ever.</p>
               <p>And thus I have ſpoken a word or two of both the Covenants ſo far as time would give me leave; and the Lord give the Reader un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and moderation.</p>

               <p>ANd in the next place, I ſhall ſpeak of the Father and the Sonne; and I ſhall begin with the words of the Son, wherein he doth exalt the Father, and deſires him to glorifie his Sonne, that the Sonne alſo glorfie thee; <hi>John</hi> 17. 1. and ſo the Son exalts the Father, and tells, that this is life eternall, to know the Father to be the onely true God, and the Sonne whom he hath ſent <hi>verſe</hi> 2. and from theſe words, I ſhall indeavour to ſpeak a word

               <p>
                  <hi>To know thee the onely true God:</hi> from theſe wordes, you have the oneneſſe of God, ſet forth to be the onely God of all Being, from whom proceedeth all things, as the Son doth acknowledge in this <hi>verſe;</hi> for the Father is the God of all Gods; and therefore he is the true God, and is the firſt God, and ſhall be the laſt God; and therefore I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſpeak of the Father, who is the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or being of all things, and ſo to know him is eternall life; and therefore I ſhall ſpeak a word or two, how to know the Father, and that in theſe three wayes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To know him in his Titles, as there are many Titles whereby he is known, he is called [<hi>Elohim</hi>] the Almighties or Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, and he is called [<hi>Elohim</hi>] ſomtimes [<hi>Eloah</hi>] the Almighty, and in ſhort [<hi>Ell</hi>] mighty, and [<hi>Eloah</hi>] hath affinity with [<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>] he adjured; but we are to know, that [<hi>Jehovah Elohim</hi>] was the Creator onely, <hi>Gen. 2. 4.

               <p>Secondly, To know the Father as he is one God, is life eternall; and that he is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone God, the Scriptures do abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he is the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 16. for he is the Father of ſpirits, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. for he is the firſt God and there is none beſides him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 35. for the Father is the God of Gods, and the Lord of Lords, and a great God, that is no reſpecter of perſons, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 17. and there is no God with him. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 39. for among the Gods there is no God like the Father; for he is God alone, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 86. 8. 10, and therefore he is above all Gods. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 95. 3. for he is called. <hi>the God of Gods Pſa.</hi> 136. 2. and he is the firſt God and the laſt God. <hi>Iſa. 44. 6. For thus ſaith the Lord, Is there any God beſides me? No I know not any, verſe.</hi> 8. And therefore the Father ſaith, <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none elſe, and there is no God beſides not; Iſaiah</hi> 45. 5. And therefore he ſaith, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>And thus you ſee the Father is before all Gods, and God alone in reſpect of his Being; and for the further probation of this truth, I ſhall come to the Confeſſion of the Sonne. who doth acknowledge the Father to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, when he ſaith, <hi>I thank thee O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent.

               </p>
               <p>And then again, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was called the Image of <hi>God;</hi> but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is called the expreſſe Image of the Fathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby it doth appear, that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is of a more glorious nature; the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> being of a earthly nature, &amp; the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> being of a ſpirituall nature; the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> being ſet about earthly things, and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> being ſet about ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, that Chriſt was begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a pure man, fit for all heavenly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; being of ſo glorious and pure a nature, that he was able to aſpire or aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for what ſhould hinder him being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way heavenly, and no way earthly in his nature; and therefore he was able to walke upon the Sea and not be drowned, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 15. and was able to paſſe thorow dores and ſtone Walls, being ſo pure a man that there was nothing could hinder him from going into any place.

               <p>4. To know him as he aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is life eternall; for being a pure heavenly man he was able to aſcend into Heaven, for what ſhould hinder him being a pure nature: being a heavenly nature, it was more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to be in Heaven then to be in earth; for it is nothing but this ſinfull nature that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us from Heaven; but Chriſt having no ſinne in his nature, there was nothing could hinder him from aſcending into Heaven. Now that Chriſt did aſcend into Heaven. Now that Chriſt did aſcend into Heaven doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, for ſaith he, <hi>No man hath aſcended up to Heaven at any time, but he that came down from Heaven, which is the Sonne of man that was in Heaven;</hi> and ſo Chriſt ſhows you, that never any man did aſcend to Heaven but himſelf, but the man Chriſt went up into Heaven; for he ſaith it, and I dare not but believe it, for his words are Spirit and Truth: no man at any time but the man Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 13. And I <hi>I came down from Heaven not to do mine own will; but the will of him that ſent me. John</hi> 6. 38. For the Father takes him up into Heaven, and revealed his mind and his will to him, what he would have him to declare to the world; and to manifeſt the Fathers love to all men, if they did imbrace his doctrine; and ſo the Father ſent him into the world, that he that believed

For the words that I ſpeak are not mine, but the words of him that ſent me.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee, the end of Chriſts come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to declare the mind of the Father to the world, which was a pure heavenly Doctrin; all tending to grace and glory, his Doctrine being all ſpirituall; and to know him in his life as he was a pure ſpirituall man, for all his thoughts were heavenly, and his words and Doctrine heavenly and all his actions heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So that it might truly be ſaid, he came from Heaven, being a man for Heaven and not for earth, all his actions tending Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; being indeed a man for another world, Heaven being ready to receive him, and the world being weary of him; and thus to know Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now the uſe that I make of all this, is this, It ſheweth the great &amp; exceeding love of the Father to us in revealing his mind and will to a man as we are; and that this man Chriſt ſhould be ſo gloriouſly exalted by God the Father, to be the chiefe in his Councell to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his mind to the world, and that thereby the world might be reconciled to God by the man Chriſt, in preaching mercy to us, by a man as we are, and in making a man to be a Mediatour between him and us, to raiſe him gloriouſly from the dead, and to give all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into his hands, and to make him Lord of heaven and earth, to ſet him at his right hand in glory, and to center all mercy and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Son: what greater favour could the Father of mercies ſhew us, which is a ſure teſtimony of our riſing from the dead, and of our glorification with him at the laſt day?</p>
               <p>And in the next place, I ſhall endeavour to reconcile ſome Scriptures that ſeem to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the truth of this Doctrine, and the firſt is in <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 1. 26. Let us make man:</hi> to the which I reply, That there the Father ſpeaks of his Word or Spirit, by which he made all things: <hi>For the Spirit of God moved upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; the witneſſe of two is true,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 6.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:137285:50"/> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 8. 17. And ſo the Spirit of God in the Scripture is diſtinct from God, as in many places, he might ſpeak of the Angels, as being familiar with him, whereby they might ſhew their acceptance of that work, being the great Counſell of heaven, for he could not ſpeak of the Son, as in being at that time, neither could he really be before he had a being, or elſe the Father might ſpeak in a two-fold relation, when he ſpake of man, to wit, of the work of creation, and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo he might ſpeak of the Son, but any otherwiſe he could not. Another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in <hi>John 1. 1. 2. In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and God was that word:</hi> To the which I reply, That in the beginning implies a tearm of time, but God was before all time, and that word was with God, and ſo it was before it came from him: for the word is the mind of God, and came from the heart of God, and was the power of God; for by his word he made all things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:137285:51"/> all Gods. And another Scripture is, before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was <hi>I am:</hi> And to that I reply, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was before <hi>Abraham.</hi> Firſt, he was before him in the promiſe. And ſecondly, he was before him in Gods account; for God did account of his Son before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore Chriſt might well ſay before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was <hi>I am,</hi> being the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And another Scripture is, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> which is true indeed, that the Father and the Son are one, both in mind and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Son delivering the mind of the Father, as I have ſhewed before; but elſe the Son ſaith, the Father is greater then I, and I came to do the work of him that ſent me.</p>
               <p>Now another Scripture is this, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of <hi>God,</hi> thought it no robbery to be equall with <hi>God,</hi> and the expreſs Image of the Fathers perſon: and this is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Son is ſaid to be the form or likeneſs, Picture or Image of the Fathers Perſon, but you will not ſay that the Image or Picture of a man, is the man; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image or Picture of a man, is but his form, and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Image of his Fathers Perſon, that is God by Office, but not the Father himſelf, and ſo the Son is the Image, and the Father is the ſubſtance, from whom
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:137285:51"/> all things do proceed, being the eſſence of all things, and the originall of all being. And thus in a word, as time would permit me, I have endeavoured to give unto the Father that which is his, and alſo to the Son, that which is his: the Son being the chief in the Court of the Fathers Majeſty: I ſhal deſire to honour the Son, who is ſo highly honoured of the Father; for it became the Father, of whom are all things, &amp; by whom are al things to make the Captain of our ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect through ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 8. 10.

               <p>2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> When he came to create the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Heavens and Earth that appeare to us; from whence came he but from Heaven? and where was he but in a place of glory, before theſe viſible Heavens and Earth were made? which ſhewes he was ſomewhere before in a place of glory that cannot be beheld with mortall eyes, and which cannot be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by a finall Creature, and therefore it doth appear that there is a Heaven.</p>

Again, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> beheld the back-parts of God in the Mount, his glory made them and <hi>Moſes</hi> tremble; and if his back-parts made them tremble, how then ſhould they behold his fore-parts? and where do you think the face and preſence of God is with that innumerable Company of Angels, and heavenly Hoſt? would not the preſence of one Angel make you tremble; what then

Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>the Heaven is my Throne, Iſaiah</hi> 65. 2. and thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>can Heaven above be meaſured?

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Hell.</head>
               <p>THere is ſome that ſay there is no <hi>Hell;</hi> but they might as well ſay there is no God, nor no reſurrection nor Judgement; but how will ſuch perſons anſwer this one day before the Judgement-ſeat of this great God; and I may ſay of ſuch, except they trun from this their wicked tenent: as Chriſt ſaid, Oh ye Serpents and generation of Vipers, how can ye eſcape the condemnation of <hi>Hell?</hi> for if there be no <hi>Hell,</hi> then we may live as we liſt; but ſuch do in their hearts believe there is no God, or elſe they muſt acknowledge a Hell; and therefore I ſhall endeavour by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my <hi>God,</hi> to prove that there is a Hell, and I ſhall uſe this method; firſt ſhew what I meane by Hell, and then I ſhall prove that there is a Hell.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:137285:59"/>
               <p>Now Hell is a place of condemnation, or a deprivation from the preſence of God, of Chriſt, and of grace and glory; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already,</hi> and <hi>Tophet</hi> is prepared of old, and all the wicked and ungodly ſhall go down to Hell; and Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>Go you curſed into a place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there is a condemnation doth appear for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the eſſence or being of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is ſo pure and glorious in his nature, that he abhorrs the very thoughts of ſinne; being as oppoſite as light and darkneſſe; that as he loves nothing more then goodneſſe: ſo nothing is ſo odious in his ſight as ſinne and wickedneſſe; So that, being ſo oppoſite to the eſſence and being of God, as not to enjoy his preſence; therefore there muſt be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, or ſeparation between God and ſin, and ſo there is a condemnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe God hath oppoſed ſinne at all times, as the greateſt enemy to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hath been an enemy to ſin ever ſince he was in being; and hath proclam'd it
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:137285:59"/> to be his greateſt enemy under all his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and hath ſhewed his diſpleaſure againſt it from the beginning, in ſetting all his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly hoſt againſt it, and proclaiming open war againſt it for ever, as never to enjoy his preſence, but to abide his diſpleaſure for ever; and therefore there is a condemnation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All that is oppoſite to God ſhall at laſt be condemned; &amp; what is more oppoſite to God then ſin, and ſinners, in oppoſing his power and goodneſſe, rejecting and deſpiſing his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and ſeeks to make God and his wayes contemptible; and therefore God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne ſin, and the puniſhment of ſinne ſhall extend as far as the wickedneſſe of it, and that a condemnation for ever and ever.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:137285:60"/> and hath ſought to deſtroy and rob <hi>God</hi> of his being; and therefore <hi>God</hi> doth declare, that he will puniſh ſin for ever, and condemn it from his preſence for evermore.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>God</hi> hath declared that he will condemn ſinners as well as ſin; and therefore there is a condemnation: even the Angells that fell, are reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe till the great day, and ſhall never be delivered from the wrath to come; which makes them fear and tremble, and how dareſt thou then proud man ſay, there is no Hell? doth not the Devil delude thee, that thou mayeſt at laſt lye under the ſame condemnation?</p>
               <p n="6">6. If there be no condemnation, then the condition of the wicked, is better then the condition of the people of <hi>God,</hi> then in vaine do they ſerve <hi>God,</hi> if the wicked who walke in all the wayes of wickedneſſe, and commit ſin with greedineſſe, and accompliſh all their wicked deſires; if they ſhall not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then all our holy walkings are in vaine; but what can be more contrary to <hi>GOD</hi> then this? Doth not <hi>GOD</hi> abhorre ſuch thoughts as theſe, and declared, that he
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:137285:60"/> will put a difference betweene thoſe that ſerve him, and thoſe that ſerve him not? <hi>Malachi</hi> 3. 18. and therefore there is a condemnation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If there be no condemnation, to what purpoſe are the Scriptures ſet forth? if they ſhall be ſaved that diſobey them, as well as thoſe that obey them, then the Scripture is of little uſe; but the Scripture will tell you at the laſt day, that it is in force to condemn you.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If there be no condemnation, then the Devills ſhall be ſaved, and then wickedneſſe ſhall be aſmuch honoured as goodneſſe; and then it would be beſt to walke after our own wayes, and take all the pleaſure we could in this life, if there be no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but neither ſinne nor ſinners ſhall eſcape the judgement of <hi>GOD,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a condemnation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Prophets do declare, that there is a condemnation, that all the wicked, and all Nations that forget <hi>God,</hi> ſhal go down to hell.

               <p>THere is ſome conceive, there is fulneſſe of glory in this life; but to ſuch I ſhall ſay with <hi>Paul, That if we had our portion onely in this life, we were of all men moſt miſerable:</hi> And therefore I ſhall endeavour to ſpeake a word or two of glory, and ſhew you ſome reaſon wherefore we are not in fulneſſe of glory, and ſhew you what it is to be in fulneſſe of glory.</p>
               <p>To be in the fulneſſe of glory is to injoy the fore-parts, or face, and preſence of God and Chriſt, with all the Saints, and thoſe glorious Angels to be in their preſence, and to reigne with them for ever in glory; and ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appeare, then ſhall we appeare with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3. 4. And therefore we hope for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. that we may be glorified together with him, <hi>Rom. 8. 17. For when the chiefe Shepheard ſhall appeare, then ſhall we receive a Crowne of glory that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 4.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:137285:66"/> And now I ſhall come to Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1 We are not in the fulneſſe of glory in this life, becauſe we injoy but his back-parts, not his fore-parts; we doe not injoy his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence where he is in glory with his Angels, for we are not able to apprehend his glory here, much leſſe to be in it, or injoy it in this life, for wee are not in the preſence of God, and thoſe glorious Angels in heaven; we injoy but his back-parts here in his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole, his fore-parts and glory is in the Throne, and cannot be ſeen with mortall eyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a vaile over our eies, we ſee but darkly, as through a glaſſe; we are not able to behold his face and preſence, nor to behold his glory; we ſee him yet but through the promiſes, we doe not injoy him as he his; his glory would rather affright, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us in this mortall eſtate, ſhould theſe mortall eies of ours behold the glory of the Angels, much leſſe the God of glory; <hi>for now we ſee but darkly, as through a glaſſe, but then ſhall we ſee him face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wee knew but in part, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his glory but in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part ſhall bee done away, and we ſhall know him as he is, and know all men as we are knowne of God,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:137285:66"/> be in this life, to know God and his Saints in glory, and therefore there is not fulneſſe of glory in this life, knowing ſo little of God, and ſo few of his Saints.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we ſeek for glory by patient continuance in well-doing, that we might inherit the promiſes; now if we were in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of glory, we need not ſeek for it if wee had it: But we are ſeeking for glory, and honour, and immortality, with eternall life; and therefore it doth appear we have it not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, we hope for this fulneſſe of glory, and therefore we do not injoy it, for if we did, what need we hope for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. And Chriſt in us the hope of glory; now if we had it, what need we hope, our hope were at an end, if we had the thing we hope for; to wit, fulneſſe of glory, but you ſee we have it not, and therefore we hope for it, as not having yet received it.</p>
               <p>6 The eie hath not ſeen, nor the ear hath not heard, nor ſince the beginning of the world hath it not been heard; nor none beſides God doth know what he hath prepared for them that wait for him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 644. And if wee have not yet ſeen, nor heard it, how then doe we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>njoy it; and if we are not able to conceive of the glory, how then can we bee in it; and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:137285:67"/> if none but God know it, then how can we know it?</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had as much of the Spirit of God as any man, except the Son himſelfe, and as glorious injoyments of God, being taken up into the third heavens and ſaw glory unſpeakable, which he was not able to utter nor expreſſe; and yet hee ſaith, <hi>If we had our glory only in this life, we were of all men moſt miſerable,</hi> for he looked for a more glorious injoyment then hee could injoy in this life, as you may ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19.</p>
               <p>Eightly, The Apoſtle ſaith, he was ready to be offered up, and the time of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was at hand, he had fought a good fight, and had finiſhed his courſe, had kept the faith, and henceforth was laid up for him a Crowne of righteouſneſſe, or glory, and for all them that love his appearing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8. And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Oh how great is thy goodneſſe which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee,</hi> Pſ. 31. 19. whereby you may ſee it is not in this life, it is laid up for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life, in a better Kingdome, where we ſhall be capable to receive it.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, The good Apoſtle tells you, hee did ſo run that he might obtaine; for he tell you that hee had not yet attained, neithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was he perfect; but this he did, hee forg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:137285:67"/> thoſe things that were paſt, for he did not dote upon his former goodneſſe, but was preſſing forward towards the marke, or prize of glory, that was ſet before him, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. Phil.</hi> 3. for he that is conſtant to death, ſhall receive a Crowne of life or glory, <hi>Rev</hi> 2. 10. And thus you ſee the Apoſtle was ſo farre from being puffed up with fulneſſe of glory in this life, that he tells us, he is not the man that doth injoy fulneſſe of glory, for he was ſtriving for it to make it ſure to him in this life, and ſo to wait for it in a better life, and in a better Kingdome, that he was in hope to injoy.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, The Apoſtle ſaith, I deſire to depart hence, and to go to Chriſt, which is beſt of all, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. whereby it doth appeare, that there is not fulneſſe of glory in this life; for the Apoſtle ſaith, In this we groan ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, and had rather bee abſent from the body to be preſent with the Lord: for while we are preſent in the body, wee are abſent from the Lord: And thus you ſee that the Apoſtle makes it cleare, that while wee are preſent in this body, there is not fulneſſe of glory; and therefore he deſired to leave this earthly, to injoy a heavenly Kingdome, which was more to be deſired, and abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more glorious.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:137285:68"/>
               <p>11. That which we ſee and injoy here, is but temporall, but that which we doe not ſee, and ſhall afterwards injoy, is ſpirituall and eternall glory, and therefore there is not fulneſſe of glory in this life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>12. When this earthly houſe of ours ſhall bee diſſolved, wee ſhall have a building of God, a houſe not made with hands, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the heavens, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. whereby it doth appeare that wee are not in fulneſſe of glory.</p>
               <p>13. We are not cloathed with our houſe which is from heaven, whereby we might be made fit to injoy ſuch a heavenly glory, For while we are preſent in the body, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord, and ſo ſhall be untill we are cloathed with our heavenly houſe, which will not be in this life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. 6. 8.</p>
               <p>14. When Chriſt who is our life, ſhall appeare, then ſhall wee appeare with him in glory, and then ſhall we injoy the fulneſſe of glory, and not before; and he gives you the reaſon, ſaying, We are dead, and our life, or glory, is hid with Chriſt in God; but when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appeare, then ſhall we appear with him in glory.</p>
               <p>15. Chriſt is in heaven, and we are in earth, and therefore we are not in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of glory; for Chriſt ſaith, And if I goe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:137285:68"/> to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to my ſelfe, that where I am there you may be alſo, and while we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Chriſt, who is in heaven in glory it ſelfe, how then have wee fulneſſe of glory?</p>
               <p>16. Theſe vile bodies of ours are not yet changed like unto his glorious body, we are not yet made partakers of that divine nature, till this mortall, ſhall put on immortality; and till this corruptible, ſhall put on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible; and this naturall become a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; and then ſhall we be like him as he is, but this will not be in this life, and therefore we look for it in anotherlife, <hi>Phil. 3. 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 44. 53, 54.</p>
               <p>17. We are not in the Throne, we are but in the footſtool, we are not in heaven, the fulneſſe of glory; for Chriſt is entred into his glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 28. that is into heaven where his glory is, <hi>Act. 1. 22. Heb.</hi> 4. 14. and we alſo ſhall bee in heaven, for there our glory is, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 5. having in heaven a better and induring ſubſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire a heavenly Kingdome, rather then an earthly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 28. which is reſerved for us in heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. So that you ſee there is not a fulneſſe of glory in this life.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:137285:69"/>
               <p>18. We are not yet riſen from the dead untill the reſurrection of the dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not in fulneſſe of glory; for as we have borne the image of the earthly, ſo alſo ſhall we beare the image of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when theſe vile bodies of ours ſhall be raiſed up, and made like unto his glorious body, which will not be in this life.</p>
               <p>19. We doe not yet reign with Chriſt, and therefore we are not in the fulneſſe of glory; we are not yet entred into our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to be Kings, and Prieſts, and to have that immortall Crowne, where is that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we enjoy? are we not perſecuted on all ſides? are we not accounted as the vileſt of creatures? but the Saints ſhall reigne in glory, and then ſhall all oppoſitions be trampled under their feet; they ſhall be Kings, and Prieſts, and be crowned, and ſhall live and reigne for ever with God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with Jeſus Chriſt his Son, with thoſe glorious Angels, and with all the Saints in glory; but this glory is yet to come, we are yet waiting for it.</p>
               <p>20. If we were in fulneſſe of glory, there could nothing be added to our condition, for we ſhould be perfect, we ſhould not need any thing to make our condition glorious; but the beſt of us finde abundance of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:137285:69"/> wants, we want Spirituall joy, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall peace; we want that Spirituall union and communion with our God, we have not that aſſurance in the Promiſes, but we might have more, for we cannot have the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of glory in this life, it is laid up for us in a better life.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, mortality will tell thee, oh vaine man, that thou art not in the fulneſſe of glory; ſhalt thou not dye, and where will thy fulneſſe of glory be then? that will tell thee, thou art not perfect; if thou art in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of glory, why doſt thou dye? why doſt thou hunger and thirſt? why doſt thou eate, and cloath thee? why art thou ſubject to cold, and nakedneſſe? and why doſt thou complaine of wanting, if thou waſt perfect thou couldeſt not want any thing? for did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou poſſeſſe all things, how couldeſt thou want any thing? O thou vaine man, thy condition tells thee thou wanteſt, but thy proud heart tells thee thou art full; thy condition tells thee that thou wanteſt all things, but thy proud heart tells thee, that thou wanteſt nothing; thou ſayeſt that thou art in the fulneſſe of glory in this life, but death will tell thee that thou wanteſt glory; and doſt not thou ſlight the glory to come, when thou ſayeſt, here is fulneſſe; for none
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:137285:70"/> but God alone knowes the fulneſſe of glory, and yet thou doſt: Oh vaine man, I counſell thee to buy eye-ſalve, that thou mayeſt ſee thy want of a fulneſſe of glory, for if thou doſt not now, thou wilt when it is too late. And now in the next place I ſhall ſpeake a word or two of glory, becauſe I know that many have deceived themſelves with the word (<hi>glory;</hi>) Now there is divers kinds of glory, for there is a glory of the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, for if the adminiſtration of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was glory here, how much more ſhall the adminiſtration of Righteouſnes exceed in glory? And God revealed himſelfe from the glory of the firſt, to the glory of the ſecond, from glory to glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10. There was a glory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for the Children of Iſrael could not behold his face for his glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. There was a glory of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and yet the graſſe of the field paſſed the glory of <hi>Solomon, Mat.</hi> 6. 29. and a glory of man, but all the glory of man is as the flower of the field, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
               <p>There is a glory of the Sunne, and of the Moon, and Starres, for they differ in glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 41. and glory to him that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good, and to every man that worketh good, glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 10. There is a glory in the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 23. and the Goſpel is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:137285:70"/> glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. And there is a vaine glory, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 26. There is a glory of the Saints, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 13. and a glory in affliction, and then there is a glory of the Church, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 5. 21. and there is a glory in their ſhame, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. the Saints were the glory of the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 20.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of Faith.</head>
               <p>NOw the Text ſaith, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> and therefore I ſhall endeavour to ſpeake a word or two of Faith; it is that whereby we live in Grace, and it is that whereby we are carried on to Glory; now there is a faith of the Hiſtory, and there is a faith of the Myſtery; there is a faith of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and there is a legall faith; there is a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:137285:71"/> temporary faith, and an Evangelicall faith, and the laſt is moſt excellent, being the faith of the Goſpell, that carries us on to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in the next place I ſhall ſhew you what faith is.</p>
               <p>Now faith, or beleefe, is an obedience to, or a living in all the commands of the Goſpell to Salvation; now it doth appeare that faith, or beleefe, is obedience, becauſe unbeleefe is counted rebellion, or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for ſuch as beleeve and obey are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. for he giveth the Holy Ghoſt to thoſe that obey him, <hi>Act. 5. 32. And know you not that to whom you yeeld your ſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to obey, his ſervants yee are to whom you obey; whether of ſinne unto death, or of obedience to life, Rom.</hi> 6. 16. and ye have purified your ſoules in obeying the truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 22. and thus you ſee faith, or obedience, juſtifieth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for thereby he is juſtified, and ſuch as are unbeleevers, and diſobedient, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, <hi>when Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire, to render vengeance to thoſe that obey not the Goſpel, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8. for to thoſe that are diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſt is a ſtone to ſtumble at, and a rock to be offended at, to ſuch as ſtumble at the Word, being diſobedient, and obey not that whereon they were ſet, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8. that all thoſe might be damned which obey not the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:137285:71"/> truth, but obey unrighteouſneſſe, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 10. 12. and thus you ſee that faith, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, is obedience, and rebellion or unbeleefe is diſobedience; now the great controverſie will be, whether it is Chriſts worke, or the Creatures worke to act faith; now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part hold, that it is Chriſts worke to act faith, and ſome few hold that it is the Creatures worke to act faith; now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part can never be in the beſt way, and therefore I ſhall ſide with the leſſer part, for they ſay, the fault is in the Creature that he doth not beleeve, and the greateſt Party ſay, it is not the Creatures worke to beleeve, it is Chriſts worke to act faith, and ſo they lay all the unbeleefe upon Chriſt, and therefore I ſhal prove that it is the Creatures work, and not Chriſts, to act faith.</p>
               <p>And firſt, it is the Creatures worke to beleeve, becauſe Chriſt hath done his work, for Chriſts worke was to obey the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Father, and to ſet forth ſuch a way to the world as they were to ſtand to, and to eſtabliſh that way for life, and death; and this was his worke enjoyned him from the Father, which he did in ſetting downe the minde of the Father, in all things that were neceſſary to ſalvation, which he did, and ſealed the Doctrine of the Father with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:137285:72"/> his blood, and did his worke, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>If you keepe my Commandements yee ſhall abide in my love, as I have kept my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Commandements, and abide in his love, John</hi> 15. 10. Chriſts worke was to obey the Commands of the Father; and our worke is to obey the Commands of the Sonne, and therefore it is our worke to beleeve, and not Chriſts.</p>
               <p>2. That Chriſt hath done his worke will appeare, becauſe Chriſt is entred into his reſt, and ſure he did not enter before he had done his worke, for he ſaid; <hi>He had finiſhed his courſe, and done all things that the Father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him,</hi> by perfecting the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the world, and giving Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement unto his Apoſtles, to eſtabliſh that Goſpel to the whole earth, and all things as he had commanded them, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat. 28. Act.</hi> 1. 2. and when he had finiſhed his whole worke he aſcended to the Father, and is entred into his reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. ſaying, <hi>To him that over cometh will I grant to ſit with me in my throne, as I alſo overcame, and am ſet downe with my Father in his throne,</hi> Revel. 3. 21. and therefore it doth appeare, that it is not Chriſts worke to act faith in the Creature, except you will call him in queſtion from his reſt, which I thinke you dare not.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:137285:72"/>
               <p>3. If it be Chriſts worke to act faith in the Creature, then the fault will lye in Chriſt, that the Creature doth not beleeve; and then the Father may queſtion the Sonne for all the unbeleefe in the world, ſeeing you ſay, it was Chriſts worke to act faith in the Creature, then all the fault will lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, for if he had acted faith, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould have beleeved, and ſo the Father might call the Son to an account for all the unbeleefe of the Creature; and what is this thinke you, but to pluck Chriſt out of his throne, and to take him from his reſt.</p>
               <p>4. If it be Chriſts worke to act faith in the Creature, then the Creature hath a good excuſe, and may ſay, there is no cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould be condemned for not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſeeing it was not his worke to beleeve: but the fault was in Chriſt, who did not act faith in him, and therefore he was not to blame, becauſe it was not his worke to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, but Chriſts worke; and therefore no reaſon he ſhould be condemned for anothers fault, and ſo you would excuſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and condemne Chriſt.</p>
               <p>5. Chriſt doth not act faith in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe he ſhall judge the Creature for not beleeving, for it were improper that he ſhould be the Judge that were in the fault, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:137285:73"/> condemne the creature for not beleeving, when it was never his worke to beleeve; and ſo the creature might reply unto the Judge, that he did condemne him falſely, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the creature for not beleeving, when it was Chriſts work to act faith, and not the creatures; and thus you ſee what ſad effects would follow this Tenent, that it is Chriſts worke to act faith in the creature.</p>
               <p>6. If it be Chriſts worke to act faith in the creature, then he ſhould be by that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons, becauſe he acts faith in ſome, and not in others, and yet condemns them for not doing that he ſhould do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being his worke to act faith, and not the creatures; what a reſpecter of perſons would he appeare to be, then to leave the greateſt part of the world under condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his owne default, becauſe he did not act faith in them, whereby they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Oh what a partiall Judge would you make him by this tenent! doth not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tell you, that he is no reſpecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and that he ſhall judge every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his workes, <hi>Act. 10. 34. Rom.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>7. If it be the worke of Chriſt to act faith in the creature, then what ſhall the creature be condemned for at the laſt day? ſhall the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:137285:73"/> creature be condemned for not doing good, when it was never the creatures worke to do good; if it were Chriſts worke to act all the good in the creature, and ſo few doe well, then he did intend the reſt ſhould doe ill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſay it was his worke to act the good, and not theirs; and then how can he judge them for doing that hee did intend they ſhould doe? for either hee did intend they ſhould doe well or ill: But if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they ſhould have done well, he would have acted good in them; but he did not act faith in them, and therefore hee did intend they ſhould do ill, and ſo by this you would make Chriſt the authour of all the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is committed, ſeeing, as you ſay, it was not in the creatures power to act good; and if ſo, then what ſhall the creature be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for, for doing the will of God? And thus you ſee, how ill thoſe repay God, that hold that God or Chriſt acts faith in the creature.</p>
               <p>8. If it bee Chriſts worke to act faith in the creature, then why doth he exhort them to beleeve, ſeeing it is his work, and not theirs? they might have replied to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Why doſt thou preſſe us ſo to beleeve, and act faith, ſeeing it is thy worke, and not ours?</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:137285:74"/>
               <p>9. Why doth he upbraid them for not beleeving, ſaying, <hi>Woe be to Coraiſim and Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſada,</hi> if it were his worke to beleeve, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and not theirs? Why doth he threaten them, if the worke were his, and not theirs, and lay ſuch woes upon them?</p>
               <p>10. It is ſaid, <hi>He marvelled at their unbeleefe,</hi> Mark. 6. 6. And why doth he marvell at their unbeleef, if it were his work to act faith, and not theirs?</p>
               <p>11. It is ſaid, <hi>he could not do many great works in his own Country, becauſe of their unbeleefe:</hi> And what ſhould hinder him, if it were his work to beleeve and act faith in them, and not theirs, could their unbeleef hinder him? <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 58.</p>
               <p>12. It is ſaid, <hi>That the Iſraelites were broken off through unbeleefe,</hi> Rom. 11. 20. Now how could they be broken off through unbeleef, if it were not their work to beleeve; if it be Chriſts work to beleeve, and act faith in them, then how could they be broken off, ſeeing it was Chriſts work, and not theirs?</p>
               <p>13. It is ſaid, <hi>If they abide not ſtill in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, they ſhall be grafted in;</hi> And how can their unbelief hinder them, if it were Chriſts work to act faith, and not theirs, then how could their unbeleef hinder them?</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:137285:74"/>
               <p>14. <hi>They entered not in, becauſe of unbeleef;</hi> and how could that be? if it were not their work to beleeve, then how could their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleef hinder them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>15. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Brethren take heed leſt there be in any of you an evill heart of unbeleefe to depart from the living God,</hi> verſ. 12. And how could their unbeleef hinder them, if it were Chriſts work to act faith, and not theirs?</p>
               <p>16. It is ſaid, <hi>The fearfull, and unbeleeving, ſhall have their portion in the lake,</hi> Revel. 21 8. And why ſhould they be puniſhed, if it were not their work to beleeve? if it were Chriſts work to act faith and not theirs, ſhould they be puniſhed for Chriſts not acting faith? And thus you ſee how weake this Tenet of theirs is, that hold it is Chriſts work to act faith, and not the creatures; and ſo lay all the unbeleef in the world upon the back of Chriſt, and ſo would make him ſtand at the Bar of Juſtice as the cauſe of all the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef in the world.</p>
               <p>And now in the next place, I ſhall prove that it is the creatures work to beleeve, for theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he gives the creature abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to beleeve, for he makes him a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature, and gives him knowledge and underſtanding to doe ſuch a work as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:137285:75"/> of him; for if he ſhould require the creature to doe ſuch a work, as he knew the creature were not able to do, it were unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to require it, becauſe he knew the creature was not able to perform it; but he every where condemns the creature for not doing good; and therefore it doth appear, he gives the creature ability to do good; and that I ſhall prove for theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe hee gives the creature free choice, as in all the Scripture, as, <hi>I have ſet before you life and death, chuſe you which you will,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Deut. 30. 19. And chuſe you whom you will ſerve, for I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24. 15. <hi>And when they choſe ſtrange gods, then was war in the gate,</hi> Judg. 5. 8. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Solomon, becauſe thou haſt choſen wiſdome befare riches and honour, I will give thee wiſdome above all that were before thee, or that ſhall follow after thee,</hi> 1 King. 3. 11. And <hi>David</hi> had choſen the way of Gods commandements, <hi>Pſal. 109. And ſaith the Lord, they ſhall call, but I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the feare of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 28. 29. And thus you ſee the Lord putteth the creature to his choice; now the Lords putting the creature to chuſe, and the creatures chuſing either good or evill, doth make it appear that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ability; or elſe, if the creature had
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:137285:75"/> not ability, why doth the Lord condemne the creature for not chuſing good; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mary hath choſen the better part: and his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants you are to whom you obey;</hi> whereby it doth appear, they had ability to obey either good or evill; for if they had not ability, when they doe evill, to doe good; then how could they be condemned for not doing good, ſeeing they had not ability to do otherwiſe?</p>
               <p>2. He gives the creature ability to beleeve, becauſe he charges the creature with rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion for not beleeving, ſaying to the people of <hi>Iſrael, How often would I, and you would not: And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life: And he that beleeveth not, is condemned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>already: And the unbeleeving ſhall have their portion in the lake of fire;</hi> and many Scriptures more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it doth appear, that the creature hath abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to beleeve; or elſe how could the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be charged with rebellion for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, if it had not ability to beleeve?</p>
               <p>3. Thoſe that doe not beleeve, are ſaid to reject the minde of God, as <hi>Act. 7. 51. Ye have alwayes reſiſted the holy Ghoſt, and ſeeing you reject ſo great ſalvation, loe we turne to the Gentiles, and to thoſe that alſo ſay, Chriſt is a ſtone to ſtumble at, and a rock to be offended at,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 7. And by this it doth appear, that the creature hath ability to beleeve, and obey; or elſe how
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:137285:76"/> could it be ſaid, that they rejected the minde of God, if they had not the ability to obey his minde, how could they be ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it?</p>
               <p>4. Chriſt doth not detaine and hinder men from beleeving, and therefore he gives them ability to beleeve; for if he doth not, then he hinders them from beleeving; but he doth not hinder men from beleeving, and therefore he gives them ability to beleeve. Now, you will not ſay, that Chriſt hinders any man from beleeving, will you? and if you ſay, he doth not give them ability, then you wil lay the fault upon Chriſt, and not upon the creature; for, if he doth not give them ability to doe wel, then he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the creature ſhould doe ill, which were wicked to ſay; and therefore it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that he gives the creature ability to beleeve.</p>
               <p>5. Chriſt commands men to beleeve, and therefore it doth appeare that he gives them ability to beleeve; for this is the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, that we ſhould beleeve in his Sonne, and he that doth not, makes God a Lyar, even becauſe he beleeves not in the Son of God, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 23. ver.</hi> 5. 10. and this was the teaching of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to teach men to beleeve in all their preaching;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:137285:76"/> now doth God command men to beleeve in his Sonne, and not give them ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? then how can he condemne them for not beleeving, if they were never able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? But God never gives a command, but he gives ability to beleeve, and obey his command, or elſe how could the creature be judged for breaking his commands, if he never was able to keepe them.</p>
               <p>6. It doth appeare that Chriſt gives the creature ability to beleeve; becauſe he layes the fault upon the creature for not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; for the text ſaith, <hi>He marvelled at their unbeleefe, and he could not doe many great things in his owne Country, becauſe of their unbeleefe; and he came to his owne, and his owne received him not;</hi> and he upbraided them for their unbeleefe, and many places more might be named, whereby it doth appeare they had ability to beleeve, or elſe how could they be in fault, if they were not able to beleeve; but Chriſt layes the fault upon the creature for not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, and therefore it is cleare that the creature hath ability to obey.</p>
               <p>7. Chriſt gives the creature ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, becauſe he doth condemne the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for not beleeving, ſaying, <hi>He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, is condemned already, becauſe he beleeveth not in the Sonne of God,</hi> Joh. 3. 18. and he that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:137285:77"/> beleeveth not in the Son, the wrath of God abideth on him; and by this it doth plainly appeare, that it is not Chriſts worke to act faith in the creature, but the creatures worke to beleeve, and act faith; becauſe the creature is condemned for not beleeving; and if the creature be condemned for not beleeving, then it muſt needs follow, that the creature hath ability to beleeve: for either the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is condemned for ſomething, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; now if the creature had not ability to beleeve, then it is condemned for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for not doing that it was impoſſible to doe, and that it never had ability to doe; but you ſee the creature is condemned for not beleeving, and therefore it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the creature hath ability to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, becauſe it is condemned for not doing ſomething that it might have done, and that is, for not beleeving.</p>
               <p>8. It doth appeare that the creature hath ability to beleeve and obey, becauſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is condemned as an unbeleever; for the creature could not be condemned as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleever if it never had ability to obey.</p>
               <p>9. Thoſe creatures that beleeve and obey, are juſtified, by beleeving, from all that ever they have done, <hi>Act.</hi> 13, 39. and thoſe that doe not beleeve, are condemned; and by this
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:137285:77"/> it doth appeare, that it is the creatures worke to beleeve, and that the creature hath ability to beleeve, or elſe how could he be condemned as an unbeleever.</p>
               <p>10. Our beleeving, or not beleeving, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imputed unto Chriſt, but unto our ſelves; for <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe, and the juſt ſhall live by his owne faith; ſo that our beleeving is never imputed to Chriſt: but to us, for if our belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving were imputed to him, then it would follow, that our unbeleefe would be imputed to Chriſt alſo, and ſo by that, we ſhould make Chriſt a beleever, and an unbeleever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, which is moſt abſurd; for the faith and obedience of the creature is imputed to the creature, and not to Chriſt; and alſo the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe and diſobedience of the creature is imputed to the creature, and not to Chriſt; ſo that it is plaine, it is the creatures worke to beleeve, becauſe both obedience and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is imputed to the creature.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Such as ſhall be Judged at the laſt day, ſhall be judged for their diſobedience; now if it were Chriſts work to act obedience in the creature, then what ſhall the creature be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, for Chriſts not acting obedience? for then the creature would be freed, if it were not his worke to obey, but Chriſts worke;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:137285:78"/> but the creature ſhal be judged, and not Chriſt, and therefore it is plaine, that it is the creatures worke to obey.</p>
               <p>12. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> or obedience; and that creature that is lifted up above faith and obedience, my Soule ſhal have no pleaſure in him, ſaith the Lord: and therefore it doth appeare, that it is the creatures worke to act faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for that is his Spirituall living in Grace, whereby he ſhal come to glory, and receive the end of his faith, the ſalvation of his Soule. And thus I have endeavoured to cleare my Maſter Chriſt, that the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the creature ſhal not be laid upon him, it being the creatures worke to obey, and not his; and that thereby, all men may know that duty, that it is their worke to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Goſpel, and not his; and that their not obeying the Goſpel ſhal not be laid to the charge of Chriſt, but that all men ſhal know it was their worke to obey, and not his, and ſhal be condemned at the laſt day for their not obeying.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Reſurrection.</head>
               <p>IN the dayes of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, there were ſome Sadduces that denyed the Reſurrection of the dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. 8 and ſo there are in theſe dayes, ſuch, as hold there is no Reſurrection, but in this life; and ſuch are in but a ſad condition, whoſe hope are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed from the Land of the living, and goe out of this world, worſe then they came in; for when they came into this world, there was ſome hope in them to receive a better world, but now the death of theſe men; is worſe then their birth, and beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Reſurrection is that which is deſired of all the Saints, hoping, and longing for the day, for their Redemption, to wit, <hi>the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead;</hi> for then the Saints ſhall enter into their inheritance which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them from everlaſting time; and therefore for my owne comfort, and for the comfort of the Saints, I ſhall endeavour to ſpeake a word or two of the Reſurrection; and firſt I ſhall prove, that there is a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:137285:79"/> and then I ſhall ſhew how we ſhall be raiſed.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſons to prove, that there ſhall be Reſurrection are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, God doth declare to all the world, that he did not intend the creature ſhould dye for ever; becauſe he ſent his Sonne to declare to the contrary, that all men ſhall riſe, and that he is the reſurrection of the dead, <hi>John</hi> 11. 25. and the firſt fruits of them that ſleepe; and that as he was raiſed from the dead, ſo ſhall all men be raiſed by the ſame power, and ſhall conquer and trample death under their feet.</p>
               <p>2. There will be a Reſurrection, that God may manifeſt his great power to all men in raiſing them from the dead, that thereby it may be ſeen how glorious he is in all his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, in ſo wonderfull an act, as to raiſe them from the dead, by his glorious power, which will be manifeſt at that day.</p>
               <p>3. That he might fulfill his promiſes, who hath promiſed that we ſhall ſee him as he is, and ſhall injoy his face and preſence in the Throne of his glory, with that glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Angels, that attend his preſence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his beauty, and to joy in his preſence, where is fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſure for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:137285:79"/>
               <p>4. There ſhall be a Reſurrection that hee may give unto every one according to his works, and reward the Saints with bleſſing, and the wicked with curſing, and to give to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man according to his deſert.</p>
               <p>5. There is a Reſurrection, becauſe that God hath promiſed to reſtore the Creation to its firſt purity, in making a new heaven, and a new earth, where in ſhall dwell righteouſneſſe, and to make his power and glory appear, as at the firſt.</p>
               <p>6. It hath beene the beleefe of the Saints, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection; <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that hee ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth, and though this fleſh be deſtroyed with wormes, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelfe, and mine eyes ſhall behold him, though my reines be conſumed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me,</hi> Job 19. 25, 26, 27. <hi>and then ſhall the gates of death be opened,</hi> Job 38. 17. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſetteſt me before thy face for ever,</hi> Pſal. 41. 12. And <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live together, with my dead bodies ſhall they ariſe; Awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt, for the dens is as the dens of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out her dead,</hi> Eſay 26. 19. And the Apoſtle to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. doth recite a Catalogue of the Saints, who all dyed in the faith, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on the earth, that
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:137285:80"/> they might obtaine a better reſurrection, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. 35.</p>
               <p>7. If there be no Reſurrection, then the faith of the Saints is void, and all their hopes are periſhed, and their glory is at an end, and they all as loſt creatures, and their condition very ſad.</p>
               <p>8 If there be no Reſurrection, then the Saints have loſt their reward, and all their labour is in vain, in ſeeking for a better Kingdome, and a better inheritance; for if there be no Reſurrection, then there is no heaven, nor no glory after this life; then we ſhall never injoy the preſence of God, and Chriſt, nor thoſe glorious Angels, nor the heaven of glory.</p>
               <p>9. If there be no Reſurrection, then the wicked will be in a better eſtate then the godly, for they have had their portion in this life, and have glutted themſelves with the pleaſures of this world, and have had all the delights of the ſonnes of men, and have ſatisfied their hearts to the full; and the people of God have weaned themſelves from all the pleaſures and delights of this world, and have loſt all the glory thereof, and have been deſpiſed of all men in hopes of a better life; and all in vain, if there be no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:137285:80"/>
               <p>10 If there be no Reſurrection, the wicked ſhall never be puniſhed, for all the wickedneſſe that they have acted againſt the Lord; then they will never bee called to account for all their blaſpheming his glorious Name, their ſwearing, and curſing, their drunkenneſſe, and whoredome, with their ſhedding of innocent blood, their wicked pride, and baſeneſſe, with all their abominations; if there be no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, this is the day they looke for; then they might commit all wickedneſſe with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>; for what ſhould they feare, if there be no Reſurrection?</p>
               <p>11. If there be no Reſurrection, then the Devills ſhall not be puniſhed, for they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in chaines of darkneſſe till the great day; but if there be no Reſurrection, then there will be no judgement, and ſo they will never be puniſhed; and they would not ceaſe to reigne, nor injoy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> no Reſurrection, they need not fear any judgement to come.</p>
               <p>12. If there be no Reſurrection, then we may live as we liſt, and injoy all the pleaſures we can in this life, to injoy the ſight of our eyes, and the deſires of our hearts, and eate and drinke; and be merry, for to morrow we dye, and ſo all our glory is at an end; for

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:137285:82"/> then we have onely our portion in this life; if there be no Reſurrection, then all our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is at an end.</p>
               <p>13. Thoſe that hold this Tenet; to wit, that there is no Reſurrection; whether doe not they queſtion whether there be a God? for if there be no Reſurrection, then they may queſtion whether there be a God, or if there be a God yet he is not able to performe his promiſes; for he hath made many large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that there ſhall be a Reſurrection, but he is not able to performe it, for there ſhall be none: and what do theſe men elſe, but queſtion God, and the power of God? and whether is not this blaſphemy think you, in the higheſt nature? and whether ſhall not this great God one day, judge ſuch Sadduces as theſe are?</p>
               <p>14 Whether doe not thoſe that deny the Reſurrection, queſtion all the Prophets and Apoſtles, and that which they ſpake by the mouth of God in all their Doctrine, ſpeaking of the Reſurrection, and the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and preaching the judgements of God againſt wicked men, which was a great part of their Doctrine in all their preaching? and whether do not thoſe that deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, queſtion all the reſt of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be falſe, by this their Tenet of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:137285:82"/> the Reſurrection; for if their Doctrine of the Reſurrection be falſe; then why may not you alſo queſtion all the reſt of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be falſe; for deny the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, and you may as well deny all the reſt: but how vile and wicked this Tenet is, let all wiſe men try and judge.</p>
               <p>15. Whether is not this a moſt Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Tenet, to deny the Reſurrection? and whether is not this the ſame that the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts hold, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. ſaying, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his comming, for ſince the Fathers fell aſleep all things continue as they were, from the beginning of the Creation;</hi> and being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly willing of this their wicked Tenet, not knowing, that <hi>One day with the Lord is as a thouſand yeares, and a thouſand yeares as one day;</hi> for the Lord is not ſlack of his comming, as ſome count ſlackneſſe; but is long ſuffering to us ward, not willing, or conſulting that any ſhould periſh, but that all men ſhould come to a change, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. 9. And thus you ſee there were ſuch Atheiſts in the Apoſtles times, who were wilfully ignorant of the Reſurrection, and the comming of Chriſt; but this ſhal be the perdition of ungodly men, to their utter deſtruction, and now I ſhall further prove that there is a Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt will tell thee that there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="164" facs="tcp:137285:84"/> raiſed up the Lord Jeſus, ſhall raiſe up us alſo by Ieſus, and ſhall preſent us with you,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 14. and thus the Apoſtles cleare the truth of this Doctrine, that there is a reſurrection.</p>
               <p>3. The day of Judgement will tell thee, that there is a Reſurrection; and thus ſaith the wiſe <hi>Solomon, For God ſhall bring every work into judgement, with every ſecret thing whether it be good or evill,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 14. And therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for Sodome and Gomorrah in the day of judgement, then for thoſe that reject the Goſpel,</hi> Mat. 10. 15. <hi>And I ſay unto you that for every idle word that men ſhal ſpeak they ſhall give account thereof in the day of judgement; for by thy words, thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words, thou ſhalt be condemned,</hi> Mat. 12. 36, 37. And ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The words that I have ſpoken ſhall judge you at the laſt day,</hi> Joh. 12. 48. <hi>And therefore Chriſt is ordained of God to be a judge of the quicke and the dead,</hi> Act. 20. 42. <hi>For God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteouſneſſe, by the man Chriſt whom he hath appointed,</hi> Act. 17. 31 <hi>And the diſobedient, or wicked, treaſure up wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgement of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. <hi>And when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt according to my Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 2. 16. <hi>And we ſhall all ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement ſeat of Christ,</hi> Rom. 14. 10. <hi>For to this end Christ hath dyed and roſe againe,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:137285:84"/> that he might be the Lord both of the dead and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>For we muſt all appeare before the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every man may receive according to that he hath done in the body, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>And it is appointed for all men once to dye, and after that commeth judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>And Enoch the ſeventh from Adam, propheſied of this,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Behold! the Lord commeth with ten thouſand of his Saints to execute judgement upon all,</hi> Jude 14, 15. <hi>For the Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptation, and to reſerve the unjuſt to the day of judgement to be puniſhed,</hi> 2 Pet. 29. <hi>And the Angels are reſerved in chaines of darkneſſe untill the judgement of the great day,</hi> Jude 6. And thus I have ſhewed that there is a Judgement, For it is appointed for all men once to dye, and after that, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth judgement; and therefore it is cleare that there is a Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>4. Thy conſcience will tell thee, O vain man, that there is a Reſurrection; for doth not thy conſcience tell thee, that thou muſt one day give account for all thy vaine thoughts, words, and actions, and that thou muſt appear before the great Judge: examine thy conſcience and it will tell thee, and bee as a thouſand witneſſes againſt thee; thou haſt the teſtimony within thee, that will te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie againſt thee that there is a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:137285:85"/> and judge thee one day, if thou conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueſt in that wicked opinion, thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will tell thee at thy death, there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; thou canſt not one day ſtop the mouth of conſcience, when it ſhall come and witneſſe againſt thee for all thy wicked acts: And thus you ſee it is clear that there is a Reſurrection; and now I ſhall ſpeak a word or two when it ſhall be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But now for the ſet day or houre of this Reſurrection, or Judgement, it is too high for a finite creature to know; <hi>For it is not for us to know the times or ſeaſons that the Father hath put in his owne power,</hi> Act. 1. 7. <hi>For of that day nor houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels, nor the Son himſelfe till it be revealed to him,</hi> Mat. 24. 36. And therefore I ſhall not dare, as ſome have fooliſhly done, to preſcribe or ſet forth the day of this Reſurrection or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Fathers and learned Doctors of the times in former ages, have conceived this day of the Reſurrection or Judgement to be at the end of ſix thouſand yeares; but this is but their judgement; and I ſhal alſo, under the favour of the Learned, give my judgement, as deſiring to ſee further, becauſe God hath promiſed to manifeſt more light in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes, and alſo becauſe I ſtand upon the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:137285:85"/> ſhoulders of my fore-fathers, and therefore may ſee further. Now I conceive, that as God was ſix dayes finiſhing the workes of Creation, and the ſeventh day was a Sabbath of reſt, that there is a glorious, ſpirituall meaning in all this, or elſe God could as well have finiſhed his workes in one day as in ſix, and therefore there muſt be ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning in all this, which I conceive to be this; That as God the Father was ſix dayes labouring in the workes of Creation, and finiſhed his workes in ſix dayes, and reſted the ſeventh day; it holds forth thus much, That the ſonnes and daughters of men, with the creatures alſo, ſhould bee in commotion and hard labour for ſix thouſand yeares, and that in theſe ſix thouſand yeares, he will end all war and ſtrife, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe yeares he will ſhake all Nations, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 7, 8. and will overthrow the pride and vain-glory, and falſe confidence of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and will ſhake them off their fleſhly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and beat downe all their ſtrong holds, and every fenced wal, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall lye open and naked, and ſhall have their fill of fighting, and ſhal ſee their vanity, and ſhall deſire to be at reſt, and ſhall beat all their weapons of war in peeces, and there ſhall be a ſpirit of love and union eſtabliſhed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:137285:86"/> in all Nations, neither ſhall they learn warre any more, but every man ſhall ſit under his own vine, and under his own fig-tree, and none ſhall make them afraid; for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, <hi>Eſa. 2. Mic.</hi> 4. and then ſhall the fulneſſe of the Gentiles come in, and the Jews ſhall be called, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the people of Iſrael ſhall be ſet up, and they ſhall injoy their former inheritances; to wit, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all the glory thereof, and the Lord will end the hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and travell of all Nations, and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall ſit downe at reſt: And this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Lord will doe in the ſix thouſand yeares; for he hath ſeen the ſore labour and travell of all Nations, and of every creature, and he doth intend to give them a Jubile, or Sabbath of reſt; and the ſeventh day, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth thouſand yeares, will bee a reſt to all Nations, and to every creature, from that ſore labour and travell; and all pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe ſhall be done away in thoſe daies, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come to ſeek the Lord, and to ſeek the wayes of Sion; and the Lord will extend peace to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions like a mighty River, <hi>Eſa.</hi> laſt, <hi>Revel. 21. v.</hi> 22.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:137285:86"/> and there ſhall be a fulneſſe of all the fruits of the earth, for the Winter ſhall be like the Summer, and fulneſſe ſhall be upon all the earth, for it is the Lords Jubile or Sabbath of reſt to all Nations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This Reſurrection ſhall bee at the laſt day, in the laſt age, or generation, when the number of Gods account is up, and the laſt generation ſhall be brought up, for that is the number of Gods account when the laſt generation is on foot, <hi>For the Goſpell muſt bee preached to all the world for a witneſſe to all Nations, and then ſhall the end come,</hi> Mat. 24. 14. For it doth not appeare, that Chriſt ſhall not come untill the reſtauration of all things that are written in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and that there ſhall be a new heaven, and a new earth, and a refining of all things before his glorious appearing, with that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious company, and heavenly hoſt, whom the heavens muſt containe untill that time, till all things be refined, as you may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 20, 21. For it doth appeare, that the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection ſhall not be untill the new heavens, and new earth, and that they ſhall be refined, and come forth of the new earth; and that we ſhall not riſe before, doth appeare by Scripture, which ſaith, That man lyeth downe, and riſeth not till the heavens be no

And of old haſt thou laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands, and they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt ſtand, and they ſhall all of them wax old as a garment, and as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed; as you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. 25, 26. For the ſtars of heaven, and conſtellations thereof, ſhall not give their light, the Sun ſhall be darkned in his going forth, and the Moon ſhall not cauſe her light to ſhine, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 13. 10. For the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do ſhake, the earth is utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe, the earth is cleane diſſolved, the earth is moved exceedingly, the earth ſhall reel too and fro like a drunken man, and ſhall be removed like a cottage, and the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it, and it ſhall fall and not riſe againe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 24. 18, 19, 20. And all the hoſt of heaven ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and the heavens ſhall be rolled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a ſcrole, and all their hoſt ſhall fall downe, as a leafe falleth off from the Vine; and as a falling Fig from the Fig. tree, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 34. 4. Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath, for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſhall vaniſh away like ſmoake, and the

For behold I create new heavens, and a new earth, and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come in minde, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65. 17. And by all this it doth appeare, that there ſhall be new heavens, and a new earth, for this Propheſie muſt be fulfilled before the comming of Chriſt, whom the heavens muſt contain untill the reſtoring of all things that are written in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. which the words of Chriſt ſeem to clear in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. where he ſaith, The Sunne ſhall be darkned, and the Moone ſhall not give her light, and the Stars ſhal fal from heaven, and the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken: And all this before the comming of Chriſt, whereby it doth appeare, that the Reſurrection will not be untill there is a new heaven, and a new earth. For the Apoſtle ſaith, The heavens, and the earth, which now are, by the word of the Lord are kept in ſtore, and are reſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgement, in which the heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noiſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, and the earth alſo, and the works thereof ſhall be burnt up: And ſeeing all theſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:137285:88"/> looking for, and haſting unto the comming of the day of God, wherein the heavens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on fire ſhall be diſſolved, and the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall melt with fervent heat; as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. 10. 12. And by all this it doth appear, that there ſhall be a wonderfull change, before the comming of Chriſt, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the heaven, and in the earth, and a purging of all things by fire, and the old heaven and earth diſſolved, as not being fit to entertaine ſuch a glorious judge, and ſuch a heavenly hoſt, becauſe the heaven and earth are both polluted with ſinne, and therefore they muſt be burnt up, and all the noyſome ſcents and ſtinkes, and evill vapours of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and all noyſome ſcents, and all things that are corrupted with ſinne, ſhall be diſſolved and burnt up, as not fit to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch a glorious Judge, and therefore there muſt be a new heaven, and a new earth, wherein dwels righteouſneſſe, the firſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth being not able to ſtand before his preſence; and therefore there will be a new heaven, and a new earth; as you may ſee, <hi>Revel. 21. 1. And I ſaw a new heaven, and a new earth, for the firſt heaven, and the firſt earth were paſſed away, and there was no more Sea:</hi> And all this is a preparation for the great Judge.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:137285:88"/>4. When all theſe things are come to paſſe then this ſhall be the ſigne of the comming of the Sonne of man, which will be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all the world, for then will the Lord Jeſus Chriſt appeare from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, 2 <hi>Theſſ. 1. 7, 8. For as the lightning commeth out of the East, and ſhineth even to the Weſt, even ſo ſhall the comming of the Son of man be,</hi> Mat. 24. 27. And all the wicked families that are upon the earth, at that time, ſhall mourne, when they ſhall ſee the Son of man comming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory: and then ſhall the Lord Chriſt ſend his Angels with the ſound of a great Trumpet to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the Saints, who ſhall be raiſed from their ſleep by the ſound of the great Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and the Angels ſhall gather together all the Saints from the foure winds, from one end of the earth to the other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 31. For thoſe that have dyed in the faith of Chriſt, ſhall riſe firſt, being awakened out of ſleep with the voice of the Archangell, and with the Trump of God, and ſhall all be gathered together in a moment, to meet the great Judge, and to rejoyce in his glory, and in their glorious deliverance, being now to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his preſence forever, with all his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angels, and ſhall now come to be
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:137285:89"/> Judges of their enemies, and ſit down with the great Judge to judge all their enemies; and therefore it is that the Saints ſhall riſe firſt, that they may lay open their grievances before the great Judge, of all their great wrongs, and bring in their evidences againſt the wicked for all their hard uſage, and cruel perſecution of their enemies, and the Saints ſhall be gloriouſly honoured at that day, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Judge on their ſide to their great joy and comfort; and to the terror of their enemies.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Reſurrection of the Saints ſhall be glorious, in being raiſed out of the new earth, and all the corruption burnt up, and ſo are raiſed out of pure matter; <hi>For it was ſowne a corruptible body, but it ſhall be raiſed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible body; for as we have borne the image of the earthly, ſo we ſhall alſo beare the image of the heavenly; for it is ſowne a naturall body, and it is raiſed a ſpirituall body, and this in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt Trump, for the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and we ſhall be changed,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 44. 48. 52. <hi>For this corruptible ſhall put on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this mortall ſhall put on immortality; and when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortall ſhall put on immortality; then ſhall be brought to paſſe that ſaying that is written, Death

                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:137285:110"/> for thou canſt hardly read plaine, and yet thou doſt deſpiſe the letter of thy Learning, for how wouldeſt thou know that God Created all things in ſix dayes, but by the Letter? and how wouldeſt thou know what God did every day, but by the Letter? and how couldeſt thou know that the Heaven was called Heaven, and the Earth was called Earth, but by the Letter? and how couldeſt thou know the name of the Sun, or the name of the Moon, and Stars, but by the Letter that calls them ſo? and how didſt thou know the names of Day, and Night without the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? and how commeſt thou to know the names of the Creatures both in the Aire, as the Fowles of the Aire, and the names of the Beaſts of the Field, with the Fiſhes in the Sea? how commeſt thou to know the names of all theſe? doth not the Letter of the the Word tell thee? or elſe, how couldſt thou know their names?</p>
               <p>Againe, how doſt thou know there was an <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but by the Letter? and how doſt thou know the world was deſtroyed by Water at <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, but by the Letter of the Word? and how doſt thou know that <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Family were ſaved in the Arke, but by the Letter? and how doſt thou know
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:137285:110"/> there was an <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> but by the Letter? that there was a <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> a people of Iſrael, that were in Aegypt, and came into tht Land of Canaan, doth not the Letter tell thee this, or elſe how couldeſt thou know it? and here I might be large, to teach thee to learne thy Letters, and to know the Letter of the Scripture; but thy pride will ſtop thy learning, and yet I ſhall leave thee without excuſe. How commeſt thou to know there is a Chriſt, but by the letter of the Word? and how cameſt thou to know that Chriſt dyed, and roſe againe, and aſcended into Heaven, but by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Word? and how knoweſt thou what Chriſt dyed for, that he came to ſave Sinners, and to open a doore of Salvation to the world, and that there is Salvation in him for ſinners? How cameſt thou to know all this, but by the Letter of the Word? and how commeſt thou to know there is a Goſpell, and Grace, Mercy, and Salvation held forth in this Goſpell, but by the Letter? And then againe, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt thou to know that there is a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and a Hell, and that there ſhall be a Reſurrection, and a Judgement, and that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:137285:111"/> thou ſhalt riſe at the laſt Day? How commeſt thou to know all theſe things, but by the Letter of the Word? ſure hadſt thou learned the Letter better, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not have deſpiſed thy Maſter; it is the Letter of the Word of God, that hath taught thee what thou haſt, and thou art a good Scholler to deſpiſe thy Maſter; How doſt thou know that there is ſinne, but by the Letter? and that there is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and that the Devill and wicked men ſhall be puniſhed for ever, and that the godly ſhall be bleſſed for ever? How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt thou to know all theſe things, but by the Letter of the Word? thou mayeſt thank the Letter of the Word for all thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or elſe thou mighteſt have been like unto the Eaſt Indians, that know not their right hand from their left, for it is the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Word that hath taught thee thy wiſdome, and the Devill hath taught thee thy pride, and yet I wiſh thee better then thou doſt thy ſelfe, for the Letter of the Scripture would faine keepe thee, and yet I thinke the Devill will take thee.</p>
               <p>And yet I ſhall ſpeake a word or two more for viſible worſhip, for ought we not to ſerve God as well with our bodies as with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:137285:111"/> our hearts? Can wee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erve God within; and the Devill without? ſure no man can ſerve two Maſters, for out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh; for thou ſheweſt by thy words what is within; for as thy heart is, ſo are thy words, but it is a ſigne there is no worſhip in thy heart, becauſe there is none in thy words; or elſe thou doſt diſſemble with thy ſelfe. Why ought we not as well to ſerve God in our Bodies as in our Soules? Will the worſhip of God hinder us? and why can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not we know as much in a viſible way as thou doſt out? Doſt thou thinke that the Worſhip of the Goſpell, and the Lawes and Ordinances thereof, doth hinder us from knowing the minde of God? ſure this is but the doctrine of the Serpent; for our obedience to the Commands of Jeſus Chriſt doth not hinder us, but fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us to know his minde: For, <hi>the humble he will teach, and he rejecteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our living in the Commands of Chriſt will not hinder us, but helpe us to know the minde of God; for the Promiſe is to ſuch as walke in his way, and that he that doth his Will ſhall know his minde;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:137285:112"/> and therefore it doth appeare, that the Commands of Chriſt doth not hinder us from knowing the Myſteries of God: thou wouldeſt take us off of our obedience from ſerving of God, to ſerve the Devill; for the Devill hath deceived thee, and thou wouldeſt deceive; as thou wouldeſt bring us out of order into confuſion, to walke in confuſion like thy ſelfe; thou art of no Religion, and yet thou canſt be of any; and thy Religion changes as oft as thy thoughts; thou art reſtleſſe in thy thoughts, and reſtleſſe in thy life, and alſo as reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in thy comforts; for thou art in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon, and the height of confuſion, for thou liveſt a confuſed life, thou lyeſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and there thou liveſt; how long wilt thou walke in confuſion? wilt thou not returne into order leſt thou dye in confuſion, and fall into the wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Jehovah.</p>

            <head>A Poſtſcript to a Party called <hi>Seekers,</hi> or thoſe that call themſelves <hi>Mad-men,</hi> which deny the Bible to be Scripture, or the Word of <hi>GOD.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Devill hath alwayes in all Ages ſought to blinde the eyes of the people, for he can fit himſelfe for all Ages; and he is more ſubtill in this Age, then in other Ages; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I conceive is this, becauſe people are come to ſee further then they have done in former times into the word of God, and his worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore it is the ſubtilty of Sathan in theſe dayes to ſeeke to take us off all worſhip and to deny the Bible to be the word of God, and ſo teaches men to deny that there is any rule to walke by, but that every man may walke according to the dictates of his owne heart, and as it ſeemeth good in his owne eyes; and this is a pleaſing bait to take the world with: and here the old Serpent doth prevaile, and ſnares the ſonnes of men; for this is the day he lookes for, if he can take men off the word, that thereby they may deny all Scriptures, and
<pb facs="tcp:137285:114"/> all Viſible Worſhip, then they will be his owne children of the tribe of diſobedience, begotten by the ſeed of the Serpent, and travelling towards the land of confuſion, that they may arrive at the anger of God; and becauſe the word is made ſo contemptible in theſe dayes, I ſhall endeavour for the ſtrengthning of ſome, and the confirming of others, to give you ſome reaſons, wherefore the things contained in the Bible, are the word of God.</p>
            <p>And firſt, by the workes of Creation, it doth appear that this is a truth; for if the Lord hath taken ſo much care of the workes of Creation to preſerve them, doe you think that his care will bee leſſe to preſerve his Word? Doth not hee magnifie his Name, and his word above all things? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 2. And hath he not more care of his word with the letters and ſillables thereof, then of the Starres of heaven? for if his care bee ſo great to preſerve the workes of Creation; how much more ſhall his care be to preſerve his Word? whereby his Name and Power might be known to all Nations.</p>
            <p>2 If the Letter and Word of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were not true, then what priviledge had the Jews which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in
<pb facs="tcp:137285:114"/> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1. 2. That unto them were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God: now what praiſe is to the Jewes, if their Oracles were not true? then they had little priviledge above the Gentiles, which is ſo much ſpoken of; for if the Letter and Word be corrupted, then what was their priviledge above other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>3 Theſe ſixteene hundred yeares, and more, ſince the Jewes have beene caſt off from being the Church of God, and have been ſcattered for their ſinnes upon the face of the whole earth, and have been the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies to the Goſpell of any people; and yet for all this, it cannot be proved that they have corrupted the Scripture, but that the Hebrew Text remaineth as it was in the Apoſtles dayes; and ſhall wee thinke that they were leſſe carefull in former times when they were the Church of God? for they have been theſe many yeares ſo carefull, that if any fault eſcaped the Scribe, that Book was not allowed to bee read in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, untill it were corrected: for they have theſe rules, that if the Booke of the Law want but a letter; or if the forme of any let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be not perfect, it was for children, and not for Church. <hi>Maim in Sepher Torah C.</hi> 10.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:137285:115"/>
            <p>4 What is 70 yeares to corrupt all Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies; when as a Copy written on Parchment as their manner was, will indure many 70 years intire? <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> with ſome Jews, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a while in the Land; and <hi>Ezekiel, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> with many godly men that were in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> with <hi>Ezra</hi> that learned Prieſt, and Scribe, came with the people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and they had alſo other Prophets amongſt them, as <hi>Haggai, Zachariah,</hi> and <hi>Malachi;</hi> and how doe you thinke that the Word ſhould be corrupted, having ſuch a glorious company, both of Prophets, Scribes, and wiſe men? whereby it doth appeare, that the Scripture is not corrupted, but doth remaine the Word of God.</p>
            <p>5 Doth not Chriſt reprove the Prieſts, and Scribes, with the Phariſees, for corrupting the Law by wrong interpretation, as you may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 15. and 23? Now it doth appeare, if they had violated and falſified the Scriptures, that Chriſt would have reproved them for it; would not Chriſt have told them ſaying, you have falſified the Scripture? but he doth not, and therefore it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the Scriptures are true.</p>
            <p>6 If the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament had been falſe, would Chriſt have exhorted
<pb facs="tcp:137285:115"/> them to have read the Scriptures, <hi>Luke 16 Iohn 5. 2 Pet.</hi> 1? If they had beene wrong, would not Chriſt and his Apoſtles have left a perfect Canon of the word to the Church, and to all the world? but we ſee that Chriſt doth confirme the Law in every point, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 18. And therefore it doth appeare that the Bible is true.</p>
            <p>7 It cannot appeare that the Bible ſhould be corrupted ſince, for beſides the Apoſtles, there were many thouſand of learned Jewes, and the Churches of the Jewes that came to profeſſe the Goſpel, <hi>Act. 21. 20. Iames</hi> 1. 1. and the truth being ſo gloriouſly planted, that it doth appeare that the word could not be corrupted ſince.</p>
            <p>8 It doth appeare that the Bible is the word of God, becauſe it holds out holineſſe more then any Booke in the world; for there is no Booke in the world parallel with it, in reſpect of holineſſe, whereby it doth appeare that it is the word of God.</p>
            <p>9 It doth appeare that the Scriptures in the Originall Text are the word of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold forth a ſelf-denying creature, more then any Book beſides in the world; and therefore it doth appeare that it is the word of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:137285:116"/>
            <p>10 There is nothing in the world that doth diſcover the wicked wayes of men more then the Scripture doth, and therefore it doth appeare that it is the Word of God, becauſe there is no Booke more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to diſcover the wickedneſſe of the Creature.</p>
            <p>11 In reſpect of the matter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby it doth appeare to be the Word of God, for there cannot be more glorious matter for the Creature to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon, whereby it doth appeare to be the Word of God.</p>
            <p>12 The right juſtice and judgement in the Word doth make it appeare to be the Word of God, in holding forth ſuch pure juſtice and judgement as all the Bookes in the world cannot, nor doe not hold forth the ſame, whereby it doth appeare to be the Word of God.</p>
            <p>13 Gods preſervation of the Scriptures in all Ages doth make it appeare that it is the Word of God, ſo as all the enemies thereof were not able to deſtroy it, nor yet are, although the Scriptures have had many thouſands of enemies; and being ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preſerved in all Ages, againſt all oppoſers, doth make it appeare that it is the Word of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:137285:116"/>
            <p>14 The Scriptures, or Bible doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be the Word of God, becauſe thoſe things that have been propheſied of therein, have come to paſſe in all Ages, and things have fallen out in every Age according to their ſeverall Propheſies; and all this being ſo, doth make it plainly appeare, that the Scriptures are the Word of God.</p>
            <p>15 By the powerfull effects that the Word hath wrought, and doth yet worke upon the hearts and Conſciences of men, as to avoyd the evill, and to chuſe the good, doth make it appeare to be the Scripture of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the wonderfull effects that have been wrought thereby in all ages.</p>
            <p>16 It doth appeare it is not the word of the Devill, becauſe it doth diſcover his wicked names and titles, as alſo his wicked nature, with the terrible Judgements that are preſcribed againſt him, all which doth make it appeare that it is the Word of God; for moſt certaine it is, that the Devill would never ſpeake againſt himſelfe, to judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, were there not a greater to diſcover and to judge him, which is the Word of God.</p>
            <p>17 It doth appeare that it is not the Word of man, becauſe it holds forth the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:137285:117"/> of the Creature; as alſo his eternall Judgement; and moſt apparent it is, that the Creature would never condemne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe eternally, were there not a greater to condemne him, which is the Word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And now becauſe thoſe that deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God, are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon nothing but their owne Dictates, which is the ground of their principles, whereby they ſay, they know all things; becauſe they ſay, God is in them, and that they know that which God knowes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the chiefeſt of theſe I ſhall preſcribe ſome worke, becauſe they ſay, they know all things, to anſwer to theſe queſtions or quaeries: And,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whether is that precept, injoyned by Chriſt, to goe preach, and baptiſe? and if you ſay it is, then where, and when ceaſed?</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whether doth not the viſible Creation hold forth a viſible Worſhip? and whether ſhall a viſible Worſhip ceaſe untill the viſible Creation ceaſe? &amp;c.</p>
